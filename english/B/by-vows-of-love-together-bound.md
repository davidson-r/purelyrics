title: By Vows Of Love Together Bound

<br/>
By vows of love together bound,<br/>
The twain, on earth, are one;<br/>
One may their hearts, O Lord, be found,<br/>
Till earthly cares are done.<br/>
<br/>
As from the home of earlier years<br/>
They wander, hand in hand,<br/>
To pass along, with smiles and tears,<br/>
The path of Thy command.<br/>
<br/>
With more than earthly parents’ care,<br/>
Do Thou their steps attend;<br/>
And with the joys or woes they share,<br/>
Thy loving kindness blend.<br/>
<br/>
O let the memory of this hour<br/>
In future years come nigh<br/>
To bind, with sweet, attractive power,<br/>
And cheer them till they die.<br/>
<br/>
And to that blessèd, fadeless land,<br/>
Where partings may not be,<br/>
Lead them a happy household band<br/>
Forever near to Thee.<br/>
