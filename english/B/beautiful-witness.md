Jimmie, said his kind protector,<br/>
Long his faithful friend and guide,<br/>
Jimmie, do you love the Savior?<br/>
Yes, the happy child replied.<br/>
Can you tell how much you love Him?<br/>
All my heart to Him I give;<br/>
Love my Savior? Yes, forever,<br/>
I will try for Him to live.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful witness for God is he,<br/>
The tears of the orphan are wiped away,<br/>
I love Jesus, and Jesus loves me;<br/>
And that is all I’ve got to say.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas the Holy Spirit led him<br/>
In the pleasant way of truth,<br/>
And he sought and found the Savior<br/>
In the early days of youth.<br/>
Should he live till years have sprinkled<br/>
O’er his brow the frost of age,<br/>
Sweet to him the words of comfort,<br/>
From the Bible’s sacred page.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Children, we may love the Savior;<br/>
If we seek Him, we shall find;<br/>
Are we ready now to serve Him<br/>
With our heart, our strength, and mind?<br/>
Think of all His tender mercies,<br/>
All the wonders He has done.<br/>
Little Jimmie’s bright example<br/>
Let us follow, every one.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
