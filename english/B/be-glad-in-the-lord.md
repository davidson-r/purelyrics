<br/>
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,<br/>
All ye that are upright in heart;<br/>
And ye that have made Him your choice,<br/>
Bid sadness and sorrow depart.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice,<br/>
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice;<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice,<br/>
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice<br/>
<br/>
Be joyful, for He is the Lord,<br/>
On earth and in Heaven supreme;<br/>
He fashions and rules by His word—<br/>
The ‘Mighty’ and ‘Strong’ to redeem.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
What though in the conflict for right<br/>
Your enemies almost prevail?<br/>
God’s armies, just hid from your sight,<br/>
Are more than the foes which assail.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though darkness surround you by day,<br/>
Your sky by the night be o’ercast,<br/>
Let nothing your spirit dismay,<br/>
But trust till the danger is past.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,<br/>
His praises proclaiming in song;<br/>
With harp and with organ and voice<br/>
The loud hallelujahs prolong!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
