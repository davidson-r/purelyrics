<br/>
Blest morning, whose young dawning rays<br/>
Beheld our rising God,<br/>
That saw Him triumph o’er the dust,<br/>
And leave His dark abode!<br/>
<br/>
In the cold prison of a tomb<br/>
The dead Redeemer lay,<br/>
Till the revolving skies had brought<br/>
The third, th’appointed day.<br/>
<br/>
Hell and the grave unite their force<br/>
To hold our God in vain;<br/>
The sleeping Conqueror arose,<br/>
And burst their feeble chain.<br/>
<br/>
To Thy great Name, almighty Lord,<br/>
These sacred hours we pay;<br/>
And loud hosannahs shall proclaim<br/>
The triumph of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Salvation and immortal praise<br/>
To our victorious King;<br/>
Let Heav’n, and earth, and rocks, and seas,<br/>
With glad hosannahs ring.<br/>
