<br/>
Because you live again, O Rose<br/>
Who bloomed in Guadalupe's snows,<br/>
In this your image, flow'ring fair,<br/>
Our songs as flowers fill the air. <br/>
<br/>
O Virgin, Rose in brambles grown,<br/>
Who chose this people for your own<br/>
Your flow'ring image glorifies<br/>
The tangled brushwood of our lives. <br/>
<br/>
God made you lovely past compare,<br/>
Your life was one unfolding prayer;<br/>
And then He fashioned you again,<br/>
An image which He gave to men. <br/>
<br/>
We pray, protect us as your own<br/>
And intercede at Heaven's throne;<br/>
While here we kneel before your face,<br/>
Send down a ray of saving grace. <br/>
