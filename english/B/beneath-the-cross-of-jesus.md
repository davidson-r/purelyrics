title: Beneath The Cross Of Jesus

<br/>
Beneath the cross of Jesus I fain would take my stand,<br/>
The shadow of a mighty rock within a weary land;<br/>
A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way,<br/>
From the burning of the noontide heat, and the burden of the day.<br/>
<br/>
O safe and happy shelter, O refuge tried and sweet,<br/>
O trysting place where Heaven’s love and Heaven’s justice meet!<br/>
As to the holy patriarch that wondrous dream was given,<br/>
So seems my Savior’s cross to me, a ladder up to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
There lies beneath its shadow but on the further side<br/>
The darkness of an awful grave that gapes both deep and wide<br/>
And there between us stands the cross two arms outstretched to save<br/>
A watchman set to guard the way from that eternal grave.<br/>
<br/>
Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see<br/>
The very dying form of One Who suffered there for me;<br/>
And from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess;<br/>
The wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness.<br/>
<br/>
I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place;<br/>
I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face;<br/>
Content to let the world go by to know no gain or loss,<br/>
My sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross.<br/>
