title: Beautiful Star

<center>
The wise men of old saw a beautiful star,<br/>
Led on by its glory they traveled afar;<br/>
O’er mountain and valley ’til wanderings past,<br/>
Their gifts at the feet of the Savior they cast.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful beautiful star of the east<br/>
Beautiful beautiful star of the east<br/>
Scatter the shadows of sin far away,<br/>
Lead us to Jesus, the Star of the day.<br/>
<br/>
The star of the east was the herald of day,<br/>
The light everlasting that fades not away;<br/>
Its beams rising higher, O hasten and see,<br/>
The Light of the world shines for you and for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The star of His Word guards His people today,<br/>
To sweet joy in Jesus ’tis leading the way.<br/>
Then still let us follow and lovingly bring<br/>
Our hearts and our off’rings to Jesus our King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
To those who in darkness are straying afar,<br/>
We’ll show the pure rays of the beautiful star.<br/>
We’ll tell them of Jesus, that at His dear feet,<br/>
The saved of all nations shall joyfully meet.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
