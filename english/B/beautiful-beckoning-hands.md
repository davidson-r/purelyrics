<br/>
Beautiful hands at the gateway tonight,<br/>
Faces all shining with radiant light;<br/>
Eyes looking down from yon heavenly home,<br/>
Beautiful hands they are beckoning “come.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful hands, beckoning hands,<br/>
Calling the dear ones to heavenly lands;<br/>
Beautiful hands, beckoning hands,<br/>
Beautiful, beautiful, beckoning hands.<br/>
<br/>
Beckoning hands of a mother whose love<br/>
Sacrificed life her devotion to prove;<br/>
Hands of a father to memory dear,<br/>
Beckon up higher the waiting ones here.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful hands of a little one, see!<br/>
Baby voice calling, O mother, for thee;<br/>
Rosy cheeked darling, the light of the home,<br/>
Taken so early is beckoning “come.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beckoning hands of a husband, a wife,<br/>
Watching and waiting the loved one of life;<br/>
Hands of a brother, a sister, a friend,<br/>
Out from the gateway tonight they extend.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Brightest and best of that glorious throng,<br/>
Center of all and Theme of their song;<br/>
Jesus, our Savior, the piercèd One stands,<br/>
Lovingly calling with beckoning hands.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
