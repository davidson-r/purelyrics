<br/>
Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,<br/>
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid;<br/>
Star of the East, the horizon adorning,<br/>
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid.<br/>
<br/>
Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining;<br/>
Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;<br/>
Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,<br/>
Maker and Monarch and Savior of all!<br/>
<br/>
Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,<br/>
Odors of Edom and offerings divine?<br/>
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,<br/>
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?<br/>
<br/>
Vainly we offer each ample oblation,<br/>
Vainly with gifts would His favor secure;<br/>
Richer by far is the heartâ€™s adoration,<br/>
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.<br/>
