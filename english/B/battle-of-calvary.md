<br/>
Great Apollyon, grim and awful, steeped in gore and stained in blood<br/>
Death, with all his fearsome forces, has besieged the Son of God.<br/>
Satan, clothed with evil armor, darkly gleaming, proud and cold<br/>
Merciless, he joins the battle, armed and clad with pow’r untold.<br/>
<br/>
Bowed beneath demonic onslaughts, Jesus fights His awesome duel!<br/>
Pain devours its Holy Victim, searing, savage, raging, cruel!<br/>
Eager waits the Mouth of Sheol, huge, insatiable, and strong!<br/>
Maw agape, the Grave yearns after Holy Flesh but not for long.<br/>
<br/>
Writhing under Law’s most fearsome curse, ruined, lost, polluted, wrecked;<br/>
Languishing in Satan’s prison lie the souls of God’s elect.<br/>
At the Cross desire of Hell! Christ gives up that final Breath:<br/>
Now, at last, the choicest Captive tastes the mortal sting of Death!<br/>
<br/>
Darkness falls; the seething smoke of Hell cloaks the battlefield from view.<br/>
Down the head of God has fallen: Law and Wrath receive their due!<br/>
Satan smiles in seeming triumph, reaching out, his Prize to take.<br/>
Three brief days all Hell rejoices then the stone begins to shake!<br/>
<br/>
Now the night of wrong is ended; now the Grave has lost its Prize!<br/>
Now the Ris’n One breaks the back of Sin: There! Behold! See how Death dies!<br/>
Resurrection Light now scatters Satan’s armies from the field.<br/>
Christ has drawn the fearful sting of Death: Sheol and Abaddon yield!<br/>
<br/>
At His Glance the mighty prison built by Law and Sin falls down! <br/>
Countless in their thousand thousands, all His Ransomed praise His Crown!<br/>
Heav’n and Hell’s astonished spirits in their joy and rage all stare <br/>
At the Victor of the Cross Who won His greatest Battle there.<br/>
