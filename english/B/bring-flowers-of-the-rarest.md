<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
O Mary we crown thee with blossoms today!<br/>
Queen of the Angels and Queen of the May.<br/>
O Mary we crown thee with blossoms today,<br/>
Queen of the Angels and Queen of the May.<br/>
<br/>
Bring flowers of the rarest<br/>
bring blossoms the fairest,<br/>
from garden and woodland and hillside and dale;<br/>
our full hearts are swelling,<br/>
our glad voices telling<br/>
the praise of the loveliest flower of the vale!<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Their lady they name thee,<br/>
Their mistress proclaim thee,<br/>
Ah, grant that thy children on earth be as true<br/>
as long as the bowers<br/>
are radiant with flowers,<br/>
as long as the azure shall keep its bright hue<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing gaily in chorus;<br/>
the bright angels o'er us<br/>
re-echo the strains we begin upon earth;<br/>
their harps are repeating<br/>
the notes of our greeting,<br/>
for Mary herself is the cause of our mirth<br/>
Refrain. <br/>
