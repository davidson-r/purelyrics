<br/>
Who will take little baby?<br/>
“I,” said the water deep.<br/>
“Baby will float in his cradle boat<br/>
And I shall rock him to sleep.”<br/>
<br/>
Who will hide little baby?<br/>
“We,” said the rushes tall.<br/>
“Safely we’ll hide the baby inside,<br/>
That nobody sees him at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Who will watch o’er the baby?<br/>
Miriam whispers, “I.”<br/>
“I’m sure to hear if the baby dear<br/>
Gives even a tiny, soft cry.”<br/>
<br/>
Who will guard little baby?<br/>
Out on the waters blue?<br/>
Silently sleep, baby, safely sleep,<br/>
For God will take care of you.<br/>
