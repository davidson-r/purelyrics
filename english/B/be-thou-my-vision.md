<br/>
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;<br/>
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art<br/>
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,<br/>
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;<br/>
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;<br/>
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;<br/>
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;<br/>
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;<br/>
Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tower:<br/>
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.<br/>
<br/>
Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,<br/>
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:<br/>
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,<br/>
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.<br/>
<br/>
High King of Heaven, my victory won,<br/>
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heaven’s Sun!<br/>
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,<br/>
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.<br/>
