<center>
<br/>
Breathe on me, breath of God,<br/>
Fill me with life anew,<br/>
That I may love what Thou dost love,<br/>
And do what Thou wouldst do.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe on me, breath of God,<br/>
Until my heart is pure,<br/>
Until with Thee I will one will,<br/>
To do and to endure.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe on me, breath of God,<br/>
Blend all my soul with Thine,<br/>
Until this earthly part of me<br/>
Glows with Thy fire divine.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe on me, breath of God,<br/>
So shall I never die,<br/>
But live with Thee the perfect life<br/>
Of Thine eternity.<br/>
