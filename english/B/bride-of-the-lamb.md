<center>
Bride of the Lamb, awake, awake!<br/>
Why sleep for sorrow now?<br/>
The hope of glory, Christ, is thine,<br/>
A child of glory thou.<br/>
<br/>
Thy spirit, through the lonely night,<br/>
From earthly joy apart,<br/>
Hath sighed for One that’s far away<br/>
The Bridegroom of thy heart.<br/>
<br/>
But see! the night is waning fast,<br/>
The breaking morn is near;<br/>
And Jesus comes, with voice of love,<br/>
Thy drooping heart to cheer.<br/>
<br/>
He comes for oh, His yearning heart<br/>
No more can bear delay<br/>
To scenes of full unmingled joy<br/>
To call His bride away.<br/>
<br/>
Then weep no more; ’tis all thine own<br/>
His crown, His joy divine;<br/>
And, sweeter far than all beside,<br/>
He, He Himself is thine!
