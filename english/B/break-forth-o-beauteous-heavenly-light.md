<center>
Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,<br/>
And usher in the morning;<br/>
O shepherds, shrink not with afright,<br/>
But hear the angelâ€™s warning.<br/>
This Child, now weak in infancy,<br/>
Our confidence and joy shall be,<br/>
The power of Satan breaking,<br/>
Our peace eternal making.
