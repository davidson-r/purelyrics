<br/>
Bethlehem, of noblest cities<br/>
None can once with thee compare:<br/>
Thou alone the Lord from heaven<br/>
Didst for us Incarnate bear.<br/>
<br/>
Fairer than the sun at morning<br/>
Was the star that told his birth<br/>
To the lands their God announcing,<br/>
Hid beneath a form of earth.<br/>
<br/>
By its lambent beauty guided,<br/>
See, the Eastern Kings appear<br/>
See them bend, their gifts to offer— <br/>
Gifts of incense, gold and myrrh.<br/>
<br/>
Solemn things of mystick meaning— <br/>
Incense doth the God disclose:<br/>
Gold a Royal child proclaimeth:<br/>
Myrrh a future tomb foreshows,<br/>
<br/>
Holy Jesu, in thy brightness<br/>
To the Gentile world display’d,<br/>
With the Father and the Spirit<br/>
Praise eterne to thee be paid. Amen.<br/>
