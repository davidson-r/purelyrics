Bless√®d assurance, Jesus is mine!<br/>
O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br/>
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,<br/>
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
This is my story, this is my song,<br/>
Praising my Savior, all the day long;<br/>
This is my story, this is my song,<br/>
Praising my Savior, all the day long.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br/>
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;<br/>
Angels descending bring from above<br/>
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Perfect submission, all is at rest<br/>
I in my Savior am happy and blest,<br/>
Watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
