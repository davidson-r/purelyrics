<br/>
Bright and glorious is the sky,<br/>
Radiant are the heavens high<br/>
Where the golden stars were shining<br/>
And their rays to earth inclining,<br/>
Beckoning us to Heaven above,<br/>
Beckoning us to Heaven above.<br/>
<br/>
On that holy Christmas night<br/>
Through the darkness beamed a light<br/>
All the stars above were paling,<br/>
All their luster slowly failing,<br/>
As the Christmas star drew nigh,<br/>
As the Christmas star drew nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Sages from the East afar,<br/>
When they saw this wondrous star,<br/>
Went to the find the King of nations,<br/>
And to offer their oblations<br/>
Unto Him as Lord and King,<br/>
Unto Him as Lord and King.<br/>
<br/>
Him they found in Bethlehem,<br/>
Yet He wore no diadem;<br/>
They but saw a maiden lowly<br/>
With an Infant pure and holy,<br/>
Resting in her loving arms,<br/>
Resting in her loving arms.<br/>
<br/>
Guided by the star they found<br/>
Him Whose praise the ages sound,<br/>
We too have a star to guide us<br/>
Which forever will provide us<br/>
With the light to find our Lord,<br/>
With the light to find our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
As a star Godâ€™s holy Word<br/>
Leads us to our King and Lord;<br/>
Brightly from its sacred pages<br/>
Shall this light throughout the ages<br/>
Shine upon our path of life,<br/>
Shine upon our path of life.<br/>
