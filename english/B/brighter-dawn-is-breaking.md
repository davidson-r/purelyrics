title: Brighter Dawn Is Breaking

<center>
A brighter dawn is breaking,<br/>
And earth with praise is waking;<br/>
For Thou, O King, most highest,<br/>
The power of death defiest.<br/>
<br/>
And Thou hast come victorious,<br/>
With risen body glorious,<br/>
Who now forever livest,<br/>
And life abundant givest.<br/>
<br/>
O free the world from blindness,<br/>
And fill the world with kindness,<br/>
Give sinners resurrection,<br/>
Bring striving to perfection.<br/>
<br/>
In sickness give us healing,<br/>
In doubt Thy clear revealing,<br/>
That praise to Thee be given<br/>
In earth as in Thy Heaven.
