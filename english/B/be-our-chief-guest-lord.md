<br/>
Be our chief guest, Lord,<br/>
Lord of all living,<br/>
Lord of all loving,<br/>
This wedding day:<br/>
Bind us together<br/>
In your sure keeping,<br/>
So we may never<br/>
Wander away.<br/>
<br/>
Bless all who have brought us<br/>
Up from our childhood,<br/>
Caring, forgiving,<br/>
Through the long day:<br/>
May the same spirit<br/>
Shine in our home, Lord,<br/>
Lighting our pathway,<br/>
We humbly pray.<br/>
<br/>
Bless all our friends, Lord,<br/>
Happy and true friends,<br/>
Laughing or crying,<br/>
Always the same:<br/>
Bright with this friendship,<br/>
May our own home be<br/>
Ready to welcome<br/>
All in your name.<br/>
<br/>
Be our chief guest, Lord,<br/>
Lord of all living,<br/>
Warm with compassion<br/>
Showing the way:<br/>
Keep us together<br/>
In loving service,<br/>
Families and friends, Lord,<br/>
This wedding day. <br/>
