I sing the birth was born tonight,<br/>
The Author both of life and light:<br/>
The angels so did sound it,<br/>
The angels so did sound it, so did sound it;<br/>
The like the ravished shepherds said,<br/>
Who saw the light and were afraid,<br/>
Yet searched, and true they found it,<br/>
Yet searched, and true they found it,<br/>
True they found it, and true they found it.<br/>
<br/>
The Son of God, the eternal King,<br/>
That did us all salvation bring,<br/>
And freed the world from danger,<br/>
And freed the world from danger, freed from danger,<br/>
He whom the whole world could not take,<br/>
The Word which heaven and earth did make,<br/>
Was now laid in a manger,<br/>
Was now laid in a manger<br/>
In a manger, laid in a manger.<br/>
<br/>
What comfort do we by Him win,<br/>
Who made Himself the price of sin,<br/>
To make us heirs of glory!<br/>
To make us heirs of glory, heirs of glory!<br/>
To see this Babe, all innocence,<br/>
A Martyrs born in our defence<br/>
Can man forget the story,<br/>
Can man forget,<br/>
Can man forget the story,<br/>
Forget the story?<br/>
Can man forget the story?
