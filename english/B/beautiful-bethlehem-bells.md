title: Beautiful Bethlehem bells

<center>
Above all the roar of the cities,<br/>
And over the hills and the dells,<br/>
With a message of peace to the nations,<br/>
Ring the beautiful Bethlehem bells,<br/>
Bringing joy to the souls that are sighing<br/>
In hovels where poverty dwells—<br/>
There is life, there is life for the dying<br/>
In the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful Bethlehem bells;<br/>
Beautiful bells, beautiful bells,<br/>
Beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>
<br/>
Far off in a land that is lovely,<br/>
For the tender, sweet story it tells,<br/>
In the light of a glorious morning,<br/>
Rang the beautiful Bethlehem bells;<br/>
And still in the hearts of creation<br/>
An anthem exultingly swells<br/>
At that memory sweet of the ringing<br/>
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
They rang o’er the hills and the valleys,<br/>
They summoned the glad world that day,<br/>
From the regions of night to the manger,<br/>
Where the beautiful Child Jesus lay;<br/>
And forever and ever and ever<br/>
A wonderful melody dwells<br/>
In the tender, sweet ringing and singing<br/>
Of the beautiful Bethlehem bells.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
