<br/>
Back to the blessèd old Bible,<br/>
Back to the city of God,<br/>
Back to the oneness of Heaven,<br/>
Back where the faithful have trod.<br/>
Back from the land of confusion,<br/>
Free from the bondage of creeds;<br/>
Back to the light of the morning,<br/>
Jesus our Captain leads.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Back to the blessèd old Bible,<br/>
Back to the light of its word:<br/>
Be on our banners forever,<br/>
“Holiness unto the Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
Back to the blessèd old Bible,<br/>
Saints of Jehovah, rejoice;<br/>
Jesus is calling His people<br/>
Back to the land of their choice.<br/>
Often our fathers had sought it<br/>
While they in Babel abode,<br/>
Now we have found the fair city,<br/>
Church of the living God.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Back to the blessèd old Bible,<br/>
Leaving confusion and strife;<br/>
Fleeing from Babel to Zion,<br/>
Back to the joy of our life.<br/>
Over the mountain we wandered,<br/>
Looking in vain for the right,<br/>
Now in the evening we’ve found it,<br/>
Truth of the Gospel light.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Back to the blessèd old Bible,<br/>
Back at the Master’s call,<br/>
Back to the words of our Savior,<br/>
Loving, obeying them all.<br/>
Never in sects to be scattered,<br/>
Never again to do wrong:<br/>
Unity, holiness, Heaven,<br/>
Ever shall be our song.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
