<br/>
Behold us, Lord, before Thee met<br/>
Whom each bright angel serves and fears,<br/>
Who on Thy throne rememberest yet<br/>
Thy spotless boyhood’s quiet years;<br/>
Whose feet the hills of Nazareth trod,<br/>
Who art true Man and perfect God.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee we look, in Thee confide,<br/>
Our help is in Thine own dear Name;<br/>
For who on Jesus e’er relied,<br/>
And found not Jesus still the same?<br/>
Thus far Thy love our souls hath brought:<br/>
O stablish well what Thou hast wrought.<br/>
<br/>
From Thee was our baptismal grace,<br/>
The holy seed by Thee was sown;<br/>
And now before our Father’s face<br/>
We make the three great vows our own,<br/>
And ask, in Thine appointed way,<br/>
Confirm us in Thy grace today.<br/>
<br/>
We need Thee more than tongue can speak,<br/>
’Mid foes that well might cast us down;<br/>
But thousands, once as young and weak,<br/>
Have fought the fight, and won the crown;<br/>
We ask the help that bore them through;<br/>
We trust the Faithful and the True.<br/>
<br/>
So bless us with the gift complete<br/>
By hands of Thy chief pastors giv’n,<br/>
That awful Presence kind and sweet,<br/>
Which comes in sevenfold might from Heav’n;<br/>
Eternal Christ, to Thee we bow:<br/>
Give us Thy Spirit here and now.<br/>
