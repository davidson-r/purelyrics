<br/>
Blessed are the sons of God,<br/>
They are bought with Christ's own blood;<br/>
They are ransomed from the grave,<br/>
Life eternal they shall have:<br/>
With them numbered may we be<br/>
Here and in eternity! <br/>
<br/>
They are justified by grace,<br/>
They enjoy the Savior's peace;<br/>
All their sins are washed away,<br/>
They shall stand in God's great Day:<br/>
With them numbered may we be<br/>
Here and in eternity!<br/>
<br/>
They are lights upon the earth,<br/>
Children of a heavenly birth;<br/>
One with God, with Jesus one;<br/>
Glory is in them begun:<br/>
With them numbered may we be<br/>
Here and in eternity.<br/>
