Behold, the grace appears!<br/>
The promise is fulfilled;<br/>
Mary, the wondrous virgin, bears,<br/>
And Jesus is the Child.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord, the highest God,<br/>
Calls Him His only Son;<br/>
He bids Him rule the lands abroad,<br/>
And gives Him David’s throne.<br/>
<br/>
O’er Jacob shall He reign<br/>
With a peculiar sway;<br/>
The nations shall His grace obtain,<br/>
His kingdom ne’er decay.<br/>
<br/>
To bring the glorious news<br/>
A heav’nly form appears;<br/>
He tells the shepherds of their joys,<br/>
And banishes their fears.<br/>
<br/>
“Go, humble swains,” said he,<br/>
“To David’s city fly;<br/>
The promised Infant born today<br/>
Doth in a manger lie.”<br/>
<br/>
“With looks and hearts serene,<br/>
Go visit Christ your King;<br/>
And straight a flaming troop was seen:<br/>
The shepherds heard them sing:<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God on high!<br/>
And heav’nly peace on earth;<br/>
Goodwill to men, to angels joy,<br/>
At the Redeemer’s birth!”<br/>
<br/>
In worship so divine,<br/>
Let saints employ their tongues;<br/>
With the celestial hosts we join,<br/>
And loud repeat their songs:<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God on high!<br/>
And heav’nly peace on earth;<br/>
Goodwill to men, to angels joy,<br/>
At our Redeemer’s birth!”
