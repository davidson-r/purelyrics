The bells of Easter sweetly peal:<br/>
“Christ is risen! Christ is risen!”<br/>
They chime the hope He doth reveal,<br/>
This joyful Easter day.<br/>
The Lord of Life hath gone on high;<br/>
Christ is risen! Christ is risen!<br/>
“Rejoice,” with swelling notes they cry!<br/>
“Rejoice, rejoice!” they say.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Shines the glorious heav’nly portal!<br/>
Angel songs we almost hear!<br/>
O the joy of life immortal.<br/>
When in glory we appear.<br/>
O the joy of life immortal.<br/>
When in glory we appear.<br/>
<br/>
The shining Easter angels say:<br/>
“Christ is risen! Christ is risen!<br/>
Come, see the place where Jesus lay,<br/>
He’s ris’n: He is not here.<br/>
No longer held in death’s embrace;<br/>
Christ is risen! Christ is risen!<br/>
Ye shall behold Him face to face,<br/>
In glory to appear.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Repeat the tidings far and wide!<br/>
“Christ is risen! Christ is risen!”<br/>
No longer Christ the crucified,<br/>
But Christ the mighty King.<br/>
For us exalted evermore;<br/>
Christ is risen! Christ is risen!<br/>
While the heav’nly hosts our Lord adore,<br/>
Let all creation sing!<br/>
<br/>
