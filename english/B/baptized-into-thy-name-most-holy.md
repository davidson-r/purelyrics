Baptized into Thy Name most holy,<br/>
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
I claim a place, though weak and lowly,<br/>
Among Thy seed, Thy chosen host.<br/>
Buried with Christ and dead to sin,<br/>
Thy Spirit now shall live within.<br/>
<br/>
My loving Father, Thou dost take me<br/>
To be henceforth Thy child and heir;<br/>
My faithful Savior, Thou dost make me<br/>
The fruit of all Thy sorrows share;<br/>
Thou, Holy Ghost, wilt comfort me<br/>
When darkest clouds around I see.<br/>
<br/>
And I have vowed to fear and love Thee<br/>
And to obey Thee, Lord, alone;<br/>
Because the Holy Ghost did move me,<br/>
I dared to pledge myself Thine own,<br/>
Renouncing sin to keep the faith<br/>
And war with evil unto death.<br/>
<br/>
My faithful God, Thou failest never,<br/>
Thy cov’nant surely will abide;<br/>
Oh, cast me not away forever<br/>
Should I transgress it on my side!<br/>
Tho’ I have oft my soul defiled,<br/>
Do Thou forgive, restore, Thy child.
