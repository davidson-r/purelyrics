<br/>
Beside the Gospel pool<br/>
Appointed for the poor;<br/>
From year to year, my helpless soul<br/>
Has waited for a cure.<br/>
<br/>
How often have I seen<br/>
The healing waters move;<br/>
And others, round me, stepping in<br/>
Their efficacy prove.<br/>
<br/>
But my complaints remain,<br/>
I feel the very same;<br/>
As full of guilt, and fear, and pain.<br/>
As when at first I came.<br/>
<br/>
O would the Lord appear<br/>
My malady to heal;<br/>
He knows how long I’ve languished here;<br/>
And what distress I feel.<br/>
<br/>
How often have I thought<br/>
Why should I longer lie?<br/>
Surely the mercy I have sought<br/>
Is not for such as I.<br/>
<br/>
But whither can I go?<br/>
There is no other pool<br/>
Where streams of sovereign virtue flow<br/>
To make a sinner whole.<br/>
<br/>
Here then, from day to day,<br/>
I’ll wait, and hope, and try;<br/>
Can Jesus hear a sinner pray,<br/>
Yet suffer him to die?<br/>
<br/>
No: He is full of grace;<br/>
He never will permit<br/>
A soul, that fain would see His face,<br/>
To perish at His feet.<br/>
