<br/>
Blessèd Savior, Who hast taught me<br/>
I should live to Thee alone,<br/>
All these years Thy hand hath brought me<br/>
Since I first was made Thine own.<br/>
At the font my vows were spoken<br/>
By my parents in the Lord;<br/>
That my vows shall be unbroken<br/>
At the altar I record.<br/>
<br/>
I would trust in Thy protecting<br/>
Wholly rest upon Thine arm,<br/>
Follow wholly Thy directing,<br/>
O my only Guard from harm.<br/>
Meet me now with Thy salvation<br/>
In Thy Church’s ordered way;<br/>
Let me feel Thy confirmation<br/>
In Thy truth and fear today,<br/>
<br/>
So that might and firmness gaining,<br/>
Hope in danger, joy in grief,<br/>
Now and evermore remaining<br/>
In the one and true belief,<br/>
Resting in the Savior’s merit,<br/>
Strengthened with the Spirit’s strength<br/>
With Thy saints I may inherit<br/>
All my Father’s joy at length.<br/>

</center>
