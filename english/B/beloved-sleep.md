title: Beloved Sleep

<center>
Belovèd, sleep,<br/>
Thy conflicts now are past,<br/>
Life’s battle fought, thy bliss begun,<br/>
And thou art crowned at last.<br/>
<br/>
Rest, sweetly rest,<br/>
Thy tears are wiped away,<br/>
Thy sighing hushed, thy song begun,<br/>
And thine eternal day.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet, dreamless sleep,<br/>
The Master said, “Well done!”<br/>
Thy weary head, upon His breast,<br/>
Reclined at set of sun.<br/>
<br/>
We wait in hope<br/>
Till Jesus comes again;<br/>
We’ll meet thee then, to part to no more,<br/>
Beyond the reach of pain.<br/>
<br/>
Belovèd, sleep.
