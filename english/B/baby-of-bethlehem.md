Anointed One, Messiah, Lord.<br/>
Savior, Christ, Good News, Great Joy,<br/>
Eternal God, now dwelling with man.<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.<br/>
Immanuel, the Holy Son, Shepherd, Ruler, Mighty One.<br/>
Descended to Earth according to plan,<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With angels we sing Your glory,<br/>
With shepherds we give God praise,<br/>
With wise men we come before You,<br/>
To worship You all our days!<br/>
<br/>
The Word, now flesh, in Him is life.<br/>
One and Only, Shining Light.<br/>
Full grace and truth, we now understand,<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.<br/>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace,<br/>
Wonderful Counsâ€™lor, King of Kings.<br/>
No end there will be to Your increase,<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Alpha and Omega, Master and Friend.<br/>
All in all, Forgiver of sin,<br/>
Creator, Designer, Beginning and End.<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem.<br/>
All glory, honor, blessing and strength,<br/>
Wisdom, power, mercy and grace,<br/>
Past, present, and future contained in His hands,<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem, the Baby of Bethlehem,<br/>
The Baby of Bethlehem.
