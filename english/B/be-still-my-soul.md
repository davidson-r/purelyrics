<br/>
Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.<br/>
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.<br/>
Leave to thy God to order and provide;<br/>
In every change, He faithful will remain.<br/>
Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavenly Friend<br/>
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.<br/>
<br/>
Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake<br/>
To guide the future, as He has the past.<br/>
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;<br/>
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.<br/>
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know<br/>
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.<br/>
<br/>
Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,<br/>
And all is darkened in the vale of tears,<br/>
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,<br/>
Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.<br/>
Be still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay<br/>
From His own fullness all He takes away.<br/>
<br/>
Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on<br/>
When we shall be forever with the Lord.<br/>
When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,<br/>
Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.<br/>
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past<br/>
All safe and blessèd we shall meet at last.<br/>
<br/>
Be still, my soul: begin the song of praise<br/>
On earth, be leaving, to Thy Lord on high;<br/>
Acknowledge Him in all thy words and ways,<br/>
So shall He view thee with a well pleased eye.<br/>
Be still, my soul: the Sun of life divine<br/>
Through passing clouds shall but more brightly shine.<br/>
