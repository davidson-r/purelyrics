title: Blest Be The Tie That Binds

<br/>
Blest be the tie that binds<br/>
Our hearts in Christian love;<br/>
The fellowship of kindred minds<br/>
Is like to that above.<br/>
<br/>
Before our Father’s throne<br/>
We pour our ardent prayers;<br/>
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one<br/>
Our comforts and our cares.<br/>
<br/>
We share each other’s woes,<br/>
Our mutual burdens bear;<br/>
And often for each other flows<br/>
The sympathizing tear.<br/>
<br/>
When we asunder part,<br/>
It gives us inward pain;<br/>
But we shall still be joined in heart,<br/>
And hope to meet again.<br/>
<br/>
This glorious hope revives<br/>
Our courage by the way;<br/>
While each in expectation lives,<br/>
And longs to see the day.<br/>
<br/>
From sorrow, toil and pain,<br/>
And sin, we shall be free,<br/>
And perfect love and friendship reign<br/>
Through all eternity.<br/>
