title: Bright was the guiding star

<br/>
Bright was the guiding star that led,<br/>
With mild, benignant ray,<br/>
The Gentiles to the lowly shed,<br/>
Where the Redeemer lay.<br/>
<br/>
But lo! a brighter, clearer, light<br/>
Now points to His abode;<br/>
It shines, through sin and sorrow’s night,<br/>
To guide us to our God.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! haste to follow where it leads<br/>
The gracious call obey;<br/>
Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads,<br/>
The Christian’s destined way.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! gladly tread the narrow path,<br/>
While light and grace are given;<br/>
Who meekly follow Christ on earth<br/>
Shall reign with Him in Heaven.<br/>
