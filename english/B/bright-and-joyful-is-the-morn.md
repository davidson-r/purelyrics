<br/>
Bright and joyful is the morn,<br/>
For us to a Child is born;<br/>
From the highest realms of Heaven,<br/>
Unto us a Son is given.<br/>
<br/>
On His shoulders He shall bear<br/>
Power and majesty, and wear<br/>
On His vesture and His thigh,<br/>
Names most awful, names most high.<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful in counsel be,<br/>
Christ, the incarnate Deity;<br/>
Sire of ages, neâ€™er to cease,<br/>
King of kings, and Prince of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Come and worship at His feet;<br/>
Yield to Him the homage meet;<br/>
From the manger to the throne,<br/>
Homage due to God alone.<br/>
