title: Behold The Morning Sun

<br/>
Behold, the morning sun<br/>
Begins his glorious way;<br/>
His beams through all the nations run,<br/>
And life and light convey.<br/>
<br/>
But where the Gospel comes<br/>
It spreads diviner light;<br/>
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,<br/>
And gives the blind their sight.<br/>
<br/>
How perfect is Thy Word!<br/>
And all Thy judgments just!<br/>
For ever sure Thy promise, Lord,<br/>
And men securely trust.<br/>
<br/>
My gracious God, how plain<br/>
Are Thy directions giv’n!<br/>
O may I never read in vain,<br/>
But find the path to Heav’n!<br/>
<br/>
I hear Thy word with love,<br/>
And I would fain obey:<br/>
Send Thy good Spirit from above<br/>
To guide me, lest I stray.<br/>
<br/>
O who can ever find<br/>
The errors of his ways?<br/>
Yet with a bold, presumptuous mind<br/>
I would not dare transgress.<br/>
<br/>
Warn me of every sin,<br/>
Forgive my secret faults,<br/>
And cleanse this guilty soul of mine,<br/>
Whose crimes exceed my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
While with my heart and tongue<br/>
I spread Thy praise abroad,<br/>
Accept the worship and the song,<br/>
My Savior and my God.<br/>
