<center>
Blessèd night, when first that plain<br/>
Echoed with the joyful strain,<br/>
“Peace has come to earth again.”<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd hills, that heard the song,<br/>
Of the glorious angel throng<br/>
Swelling all your slopes along.<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Happy shepherds, on whose ear<br/>
Fell the tidings glad and clear,<br/>
“God to man is drawing near.”<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Thus revealed to shepherds’ eyes<br/>
Hidden from the great and wise,<br/>
Entering earth in lowly guise:<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
We adore Thee as our King,<br/>
And to Thee our song we sing,<br/>
Our best offering to Thee bring,<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd Babe of Bethlehem,<br/>
Owner of earth’s diadem,<br/>
Claim and wear the radiant gem<br/>
Alleluia!
