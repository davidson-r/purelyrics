Behold the great Creator makes<br/>
Himself a house of clay,<br/>
A robe of virgin flesh He takes<br/>
Which He will wear for ay.<br/>
<br/>
Hark, hark, the wise eternal Word,<br/>
Like a weak infant cries!<br/>
In form of servant is the Lord,<br/>
And God in cradles lies.<br/>
<br/>
This wonder struck the world amazed,<br/>
It shook the starry frame;<br/>
Squadrons of spirits stood and gazed,<br/>
Then down in troops they came.<br/>
<br/>
Glad shepherds ran to view this sight;<br/>
A choir of angels sings,<br/>
And eastern sages with delight<br/>
Adore this King of kings.<br/>
<br/>
Join then, all hearts that are not stone,<br/>
And all our voices prove,<br/>
To celebrate this holy One<br/>
The God of peace and love.
