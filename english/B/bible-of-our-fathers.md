The Bible of our fathers<br/>
Is the blessèd Word of God,<br/>
Its pages are inspirèd—<br/>
By its light our fathers trod.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Bible of our fathers is the book for me,<br/>
The Bible of our fathers, let it ever be;<br/>
The Bible of our fathers is good enough for me,<br/>
The Bible of our fathers, our hope eternally.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible of our fathers:<br/>
Its great promises are true,<br/>
They never fail believers;<br/>
Trust, its Gospel will save you!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Bible of our fathers,<br/>
Though attacked without, within,<br/>
Is still rejoicing millions<br/>
It is saving from their sin.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Bible of our fathers,<br/>
Only those who preach it whole<br/>
Are reaching dying sinners,<br/>
Bringing peace to the lost soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Bible of our fathers,<br/>
In the judgment day will be<br/>
The only book remaining,<br/>
Save the book of life we’ll see.<br/>
<br/>
