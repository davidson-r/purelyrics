<center>
In the little village of Bethlehem,<br/>
There lay a Child one day;<br/>
And the sky was bright with a holy light<br/>
O’er the place where Jesus lay.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia! O how the angels sang.<br/>
Alleluia! How it rang!<br/>
And the sky was bright with a holy light<br/>
’Twas the birthday of a King.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas a humble birthplace, but O how much<br/>
God gave to us that day,<br/>
From the manger bed what a path has led,<br/>
What a perfect, holy way.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
