<br/>
By precepts taught of ages past,<br/>
Now let us keep again the fast,<br/>
Which, year by year, in order meet<br/>
Of forty days is made complete.<br/>
<br/>
The law and seers that were of old<br/>
In divers ways this Lent foretold,<br/>
Which Christ Himself, the Lord and Guide<br/>
Of every season, sanctified.<br/>
<br/>
More sparing therefore let us make<br/>
The words we speak, the food we take,<br/>
Deny ourselves in mirth and sleep,<br/>
In stricter watch our senses keep.<br/>
<br/>
In prayer together let us fall,<br/>
And cry for mercy, one and all;<br/>
And weep before the Judge, and say,<br/>
O turn from us Thy wrath away.<br/>
<br/>
Thy grace have we offended sore<br/>
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br/>
Pour down upon us from above<br/>
The riches of Thy pardoning love.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, Lord, though frail we be,<br/>
That yet Thine handiwork are we:<br/>
Nor let the honor of Thy Name<br/>
Be by another put to shame.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive the ill that we have wrought,<br/>
Increase the good that we have sought;<br/>
That we at length, our wanderings oâ€™er,<br/>
May please Thee now and evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Three in One, and One in Three,<br/>
Almighty God, we pray to Thee,<br/>
That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless<br/>
Our fast with fruits of righteousness.<br/>
