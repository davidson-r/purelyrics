<br/>
Book of books, our people’s strength<br/>
Statesman’s, teacher’s, hero’s treasure,<br/>
Bringing freedom, spreading truth,<br/>
Shedding light that none can measure;<br/>
Wisdom comes to those who know thee,<br/>
All the best we have we owe thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thank we those who toiled in thought,<br/>
Many diverse scrolls completing;<br/>
Poets, prophets, scholars, saints,<br/>
Each his word from God repeating;<br/>
Till they came, who told the story<br/>
Of the Word, and showed His glory.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we God, who hath inspired<br/>
Those whose wisdom still directs us;<br/>
Praise Him for the Word made flesh,<br/>
For the Spirit which protects us.<br/>
Light of Knowledge, ever burning,<br/>
Shed on us Thy deathless learning.<br/>
