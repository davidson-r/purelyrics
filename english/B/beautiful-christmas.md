title: Beautiful Christmas

<center>
O’er the hills and adown the snowy dells,<br/>
As the echoes ring of the Christmas bells,<br/>
Angel songs in our hearts resound again,<br/>
Singing peace on earth and good will to men!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Bring pine and fir tree, weave the garlands bright,<br/>
Gladden the temple of the King tonight!<br/>
Christmas is here! Fill it with cheer;<br/>
Make it glorious with joy and light.<br/>
<br/>
Bring good will to the suffering and sad;<br/>
Speak the tender word that shall make them glad;<br/>
Tell them how, o’er the hills of Bethlehem<br/>
When the angels sang, ’twas good news for them.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Peace on earth! bid all strife and tumult cease;<br/>
For this night again gives the Lord His peace;<br/>
While our hands shall His temple beautify,<br/>
Carol, glory be unto God most high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So glad hearts on this happy Christmas night<br/>
Bring your gifts of love, make His altar bright;<br/>
Sing glad songs that shall sweetly sound as when<br/>
Angels sang of peace and good will to men.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
