<br/>
“Forever with the Lord!”<br/>
Amen, so let it be!<br/>
Life from His death is in that word<br/>
’Tis immortality.<br/>
Here in the body pent,<br/>
Absent from Him I roam,<br/>
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent<br/>
A day’s march nearer home<br/>
<br/>
My Father’s house on high,<br/>
Home of my soul, how near<br/>
At times to faith’s foreseeing eye<br/>
Thy golden gates appear!<br/>
Ah! then my spirit faints<br/>
To reach the land I love,<br/>
The bright inheritance of saints,<br/>
Jerusalem above.<br/>
<br/>
“Forever with the Lord!”<br/>
Forever in His will,<br/>
The promise of that faithful word,<br/>
Lord, here in me fulfill.<br/>
With You at my right hand,<br/>
Then I shall never fail;<br/>
Uphold me, Lord, and I shall stand,<br/>
Through grace I will prevail.<br/>
<br/>
So when my latest breath<br/>
Breaks through the veil of pain,<br/>
By death I shall escape from death,<br/>
And life eternal gain.<br/>
That resurrection word,<br/>
That shout of victory:<br/>
Once more, “Forever with the Lord!”<br/>
Amen, so let it be!<br/>
