<br/>
A few more years shall roll,<br/>
A few more seasons come,<br/>
And we shall be with those that rest<br/>
Asleep within the tomb;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that great day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O wash me in Thy precious blood,<br/>
And take my sins away.<br/>
<br/>
A few more suns shall set<br/>
O’er these dark hills of time,<br/>
And we shall be where suns are not<br/>
A far serener clime:<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that blest day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A few more storms shall beat<br/>
On this wild rocky shore,<br/>
And we shall be where tempests cease,<br/>
And surges swell no more;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that calm day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A few more struggles here,<br/>
A few more partings o’er,<br/>
A few more toils, a few more tears,<br/>
And we shall weep no more:<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that bright day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A few more Sabbaths here<br/>
Shall cheer us on our way,<br/>
And we shall reach the endless rest,<br/>
Th’eternal Sabbath day;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that sweet day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
’Tis but a little while,<br/>
And He shall come again<br/>
Who died that we might live, Who lives<br/>
That we with Him may reign;<br/>
Then, O my Lord, prepare<br/>
My soul for that glad day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
