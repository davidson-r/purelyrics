<br/>
Father, Who hast gathered<br/>
This dear child to rest,<br/>
Unto Thee we yield him,<br/>
Sure Thou knowest best.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, O Lord, Who gavest,<br/>
Dost Thine own reclaim;<br/>
Thou, O Lord, hast taken—<br/>
Blessèd still Thy Name!<br/>
<br/>
Thine by right creative,<br/>
By redemption Thine,<br/>
By regeneration<br/>
And the holy sign.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who didst endow him<br/>
With baptismal grace,<br/>
Now in love hast brought him<br/>
To behold Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
Safe from all earth’s sorrow,<br/>
Safe from all its pains,<br/>
Now this child of Adam,<br/>
Paradise regains:<br/>
<br/>
Safe from all temptation,<br/>
Safe from fear of sin,<br/>
Through the blood of sprinkling<br/>
Holy, bright and clean.<br/>
<br/>
Lay we this dear body<br/>
In the earth to sleep,<br/>
His sweet soul commending<br/>
Unto Thee to keep:<br/>
<br/>
Looking for the dawning<br/>
Of that deathless day,<br/>
When all earthly shadows<br/>
Shall have fled away.<br/>
<br/>
Only grant us, Father,<br/>
Courage in our strife,<br/>
And with him a portion<br/>
In unending life.<br/>
