<br/>
For all the blessings of the year,<br/>
For all the friends we hold so dear,<br/>
For peace on earth, both far and near,<br/>
We thank Thee, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
For life and health, those common things,<br/>
Which every day and hour brings,<br/>
For home, where our affection clings,<br/>
We thank Thee, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
For love of Thine, which never tires,<br/>
Which all our better thought inspires,<br/>
And warms our lives with heavenly fires,<br/>
We thank Thee, Lord.<br/>
