<br/>
Father of mercies! God of love!<br/>
Whose kind compassion still we prove,<br/>
Our praise accept, and bless us here,<br/>
As brought to this—another year.<br/>
<br/>
We sing Thy goodness all divine,<br/>
Whose radiant beams around us shine,<br/>
’Tis through Thy goodness we appear<br/>
Preserved to this—another year.<br/>
<br/>
Our souls, our all we here resign;<br/>
Make us, and keep us ever Thine;<br/>
And grant that in Thy love and fear<br/>
We may begin—another year.<br/>
<br/>
Be this our sweet experience still,<br/>
To know and do Thy holy will;<br/>
Then shall our souls, with joy sincere,<br/>
Bless Thee for this—another year.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Lord, through life Thy love display,<br/>
And then in death’s approaching day,<br/>
We’ll joyful part with all that’s here,<br/>
Nor wish on earth—another year.<br/>
