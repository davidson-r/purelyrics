<br/>
Fountain of mercy, God of love,<br/>
Whose gifts all creatures share,<br/>
The rolling seasons as they move<br/>
Proclaim Thy constant care.<br/>
<br/>
When in the bosom of the earth<br/>
The sower hid the grain,<br/>
Thy goodness marked its secret birth,<br/>
And sent the early rain.<br/>
<br/>
The spring’s sweet influence, Lord, was Thine,<br/>
The seasons knew Thy call;<br/>
Thou mad’st the summer sun to shine,<br/>
The summer dews to fall.<br/>
<br/>
The gifts of mercy from above<br/>
Matured the swelling grain;<br/>
And now the harvest crowns Thy love,<br/>
And plenty fills this plain.<br/>
<br/>
O ne’er may our forgetful hearts<br/>
O’erlook Thy bounteous care,<br/>
But what our Father’s hand imparts<br/>
Still own in praise and prayer.<br/>
<br/>
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
The God Whom we adore,<br/>
Be glory, as it was, is now,<br/>
And shall be evermore.<br/>
