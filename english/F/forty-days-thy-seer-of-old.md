Forty days Thy seer of old<br/>
Communed with Thee, O Most High;<br/>
Fain Thy glories to behold<br/>
And Thy glory passing by.<br/>
<br/>
In the rocky cleft he bowed;<br/>
Thou, as mortal gaze might bear,<br/>
Part revealed and part in cloud,<br/>
Didst Thy secret Name declare.<br/>
<br/>
Forth days of Easter-tide<br/>
Thou didst commune with Thine own;<br/>
Now by glimpses, Lord, descried,<br/>
Handled now and proved and known;<br/>
<br/>
Known, most Merciful, yet veiled;<br/>
Else before the awful sight<br/>
Surely heart and flesh had failed,<br/>
Smitten with exceeding light.<br/>
<br/>
Risen Master, fain would we,<br/>
Sharing those unearthly days,<br/>
Morn and eve, on shore and sea,<br/>
Watch Thy movements, mark Thy ways;<br/>
<br/>
Catch by faith each glad surprise<br/>
Of Thy footstep drawing nigh,<br/>
Hear Thy sudden greeting rise<br/>
“Peace be to you! It is I”;<br/>
<br/>
Secrets of Thy kingdom learn,<br/>
Read the visions open spread,<br/>
Feel Thy Word within us burn,<br/>
Know Thee in the broken bread.<br/>
<br/>
So Thy glory’s skirts beside<br/>
Gently led from grace to grace,<br/>
We Thy coming may abide,<br/>
And adore Thee face to face.
