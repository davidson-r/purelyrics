title: Father Whateer Of Earthly Bliss

<center>
Father, whate’er of earthly bliss<br/>
Thy sovereign will denies,<br/>
Accepted at Thy throne, let this<br/>
My humble prayer, arise:<br/>
<br/>
Give me a calm and thankful heart,<br/>
From every murmur free;<br/>
The blessing of Thy grace impart,<br/>
And make me live to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine<br/>
My life and death attend,<br/>
Thy presence through my journey shine,<br/>
And crown my journey’s end.
</center>
