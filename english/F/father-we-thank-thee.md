<br/>
Father, we thank Thee for the night,<br/>
And for the pleasant morning light;<br/>
For rest and food and loving care,<br/>
And all that makes the world so fair.<br/>
<br/>
Help us to do the things we should,<br/>
To be to others kind and good;<br/>
In all we do, in work or play,<br/>
To love Thee better day by day.<br/>
