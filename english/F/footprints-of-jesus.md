<br/>
Sweetly, Lord, have we heard Thee calling,<br/>
Come, follow Me!<br/>
And we see where Thy footprints falling<br/>
Lead us to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Footprints of Jesus,<br/>
That make the pathway glow;<br/>
We will follow the steps of Jesus<br/>
Where’er they go.<br/>
<br/>
Though they lead o’er the cold, dark mountains,<br/>
Seeking His sheep;<br/>
Or along by Siloam’s fountains,<br/>
Helping the weak.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
If they lead through the temple holy,<br/>
Preaching the Word;<br/>
Or in homes of the poor and lowly,<br/>
Serving the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though, dear Lord, in Thy pathway keeping,<br/>
We follow Thee;<br/>
Through the gloom of that place of weeping,<br/>
Gethsemane!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
If Thy way and its sorrows bearing,<br/>
We go again,<br/>
Up the slope of the hillside, bearing<br/>
Our cross of pain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
By and by, through the shining portals,<br/>
Turning our feet,<br/>
We shall walk, with the glad immortals,<br/>
Heav’n’s golden street.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then at last when on high He sees us,<br/>
Our journey done,<br/>
We will rest where the steps of Jesus<br/>
End at His throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
