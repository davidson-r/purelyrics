title: Forgive them O my Father

<br/>
“Forgive them, O my Father,<br/>
They know not what they do.”<br/>
The Savior spoke in anguish,<br/>
As sharp iron nails went through.<br/>
No word of anger spoke He<br/>
To them that shed His blood,<br/>
But prayer and tenderest pity<br/>
Large as the love of God.<br/>
<br/>
For me was that compassion,<br/>
For me that tender care;<br/>
I need His wide forgiveness<br/>
As much as any there.<br/>
It was my pride and hardness<br/>
That hung Him on the tree;<br/>
Those cruel nails, O Savior,<br/>
Were driven in by me.<br/>
<br/>
And often I have slighted<br/>
Thy gentle voice that said:<br/>
Forgive me too, Lord Jesus,<br/>
I knew not what I did.<br/>
O depth of sweet compassion!<br/>
O love divine and true!<br/>
Save Thou the souls that slight Thee,<br/>
And know not what they do.<br/>
