<br/>
Fight the good fight with all thy might;<br/>
Christ is thy Strength, and Christ thy Right;<br/>
Lay hold on life, and it shall be<br/>
Thy joy and crown eternally.<br/>
<br/>
Run the straight race through Godâ€™s good grace,<br/>
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;<br/>
Life with its way before us lies,<br/>
Christ is the Path, and Christ the Prize.<br/>
<br/>
Cast care aside, upon thy Guide,<br/>
Lean, and His mercy will provide;<br/>
Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove<br/>
Christ is its Life, and Christ its Love.<br/>
<br/>
Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,<br/>
He changeth not, and thou art dear.<br/>
Only believe, and thou shalt see<br/>
That Christ is all in all to thee.<br/>
