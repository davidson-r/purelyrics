<center>
Come, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
Whom one all-perfect God we own,<br/>
Restorer of Thine image lost,<br/>
Thy various offices make known;<br/>
Display, our fallen souls to raise,<br/>
Thy whole economy of grace.<br/>
<br/>
Jehovah in Three Persons, come,<br/>
And draw, and sprinkle us, and seal<br/>
Poor, guilty, dying worms, in whom<br/>
Thou dost eternal life reveal;<br/>
The knowledge of Thyself bestow,<br/>
And all Thy glorious goodness show.<br/>
<br/>
Soon as our pardoned hearts believe<br/>
That Thou art pure, essential love,<br/>
The proof we in ourselves receive<br/>
Of the three witnesses above;<br/>
Sure, as the saints around Thy throne,<br/>
That Father, Word, and Spirit, are One.<br/>
<br/>
O that we now, in love renewed,<br/>
Might blameless in Thy sight appear:<br/>
Wake we in Thy similitude,<br/>
Stamped with the Triune character;<br/>
Flesh, spirit, soul, to Thee resign,<br/>
And live and die entirely Thine!
