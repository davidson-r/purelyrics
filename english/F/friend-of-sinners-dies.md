title: Friend Of Sinners Dies

<center>
He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!<br/>
Lo! Salem’s daughters weep around;<br/>
A solemn darkness veils the skies,<br/>
A sudden trembling shakes the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Come, saints, and drop a tear or two<br/>
For Him who groaned beneath your load:<br/>
He shed a thousand drops for you,<br/>
A thousand drops of richer blood.<br/>
<br/>
Here’s love and grief beyond degree:<br/>
The Lord of Glory dies for men!<br/>
But lo! what sudden joys we see,<br/>
Jesus, the dead, revives again!<br/>
<br/>
The rising God forsakes the tomb;<br/>
The tomb in vain forbids His rise;<br/>
Cherubic legions guard Him home,<br/>
And shout Him welcome to the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Break off your fears, ye saints, and tell<br/>
How high your great Deliv’rer reigns;<br/>
Sing how He spoiled the hosts of hell,<br/>
And led the monster death in chains!<br/>
<br/>
Say, “Live forever, wondrous King!<br/>
Born to redeem, and strong to save;”<br/>
Then ask the monster, “Where’s thy sting?”<br/>
And, “Where’s thy vict’ry, boasting grave?”
