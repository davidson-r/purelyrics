From every spire on Christmas Eve, the Christmas bells ring clearly out<br/>
Their message of goodwill and peace, with many a call and silver shout.<br/>
For faithful hearts, the angels’ song still echoes in the frosty air,<br/>
And by the altar low they bow, in adoration and in prayer.<br/>
<br/>
A thousand blessed memories throng, the stars are holy signs to them,<br/>
And from the eyes of every child looks forth the Babe of Bethlehem;<br/>
But there are others, not like these, whose brows are sad, whose hopes are crossed,<br/>
To whom the season brings no cheer, and life’s most gracious charm is lost.<br/>
<br/>
To whom that story, old and sweet, is but a fable at the best,<br/>
The Christmas music mocks their ears, and life has naught of joy or rest.<br/>
Oh! for angel’s voice to pierce the clouds of grief that over them rise,<br/>
The mists of doubt and unbelief that veil the blue of Christmas skies.<br/>
<br/>
That they, at last, may see the Light which shines from Bethlehem, and unfold<br/>
For Christ the treasures of their hearts, richer than spicery or gold.<br/>
Hope of the ages, draw Thou near, till all the earth shall own Thy sway,<br/>
And when Thou reignest in every heart it will, indeed, be Christmas Day.
