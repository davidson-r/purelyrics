From highest heaven I come to tell<br/>
The gladdest news that e'er befell;<br/>
These tidings true to you I bring,<br/>
And gladly of them say and sing.<br/>
<br/>
'To you today is given a Child,<br/>
Born of a chosen virgin mild; [1]<br/>
That blessed Child, so sweet and kind,<br/>
Shall give you joy and peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
'Tis Christ our Lord and God indeed,<br/>
Your help and stay in every need:<br/>
Himself your Saviour He will be,<br/>
From sin and death to set you free.<br/>
<br/>
'All blessedness to you he bears<br/>
Which God the Father's love prepares;<br/>
The heavenly kingdom ye shall gain,<br/>
And now and ever with us reign.<br/>
<br/>
'Now hear the sign, and mark with care<br/>
The swaddling clothes and crib so bare;<br/>
There shall ye find this Infant laid<br/>
Who all the world upholds and made.'<br/>
<br/>
Then let us all our gladness show,<br/>
And with the joyful shepherds go<br/>
To see what God for us hath done,<br/>
In sending us his glorious Son.<br/>
<br/>
Awake, my soul! my heart, behold<br/>
Who lieth in that manger cold!<br/>
Who is this lovely baby boy?<br/>
'Tis Jesus Christ, our only joy.<br/>
<br/>
Now welcome, ever-blessed guest,<br/>
To sinful souls with guilt oppressed;<br/>
In mercy come to our distress!<br/>
How can we thank thy gentleness?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Lord, who all things didst create,<br/>
How cam'st thou to this poor estate,<br/>
To make the hay and straw thy bed,<br/>
Whereon the ox and ass are fed?<br/>
<br/>
Nay, were the world ten times so wide,<br/>
With gold and gems on every side,<br/>
Yet were it all too small to be<br/>
A narrow cradle, Lord, for thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thy samite and thy silk array<br/>
Are swathing-bands and coarsest hay<br/>
Which thou, O King, dost bathe with light<br/>
As though enthroned in heaven bright. [2]<br/>
<br/>
And all this woe hath come to thee<br/>
That thou might'st show the truth to me;<br/>
For all the power and wealth of earth [3]<br/>
To thee are vile and nothing worth.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Jesu, my heart's treasure blest,<br/>
Make thee a clean, soft cradle-nest<br/>
And rest enshrined within my heart,<br/>
That I from thee may never part.<br/>
<br/>
So shall I evermore rejoice,<br/>
And bounding sing, with heart and voice,<br/>
A lullaby which Thou wilt own,<br/>
The spirit's song of sweetest tone.<br/>
<br/>
To God on high all glory be,<br/>
Who gave His only Son for me;<br/>
For which the Angels carol clear<br/>
And sing us such a glad New Year.
