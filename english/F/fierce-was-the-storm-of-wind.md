title: Fierce Was The Storm Of Wind

<br/>
Fierce was the storm of wind,<br/>
The surging waves ran high,<br/>
Failed the disciples’ hearts with fear,<br/>
Tho’ Thou, their Lord, wast nigh.<br/>
<br/>
But at the stern rebuke,<br/>
Of Thy almighty word,<br/>
The wind was hushed, the billows ceased,<br/>
And owned Thee God and Lord.<br/>
<br/>
So now, when depths of sin,<br/>
Our souls with terrors fill,<br/>
Arise, and be our Helper, Lord,<br/>
And speak Thy “Peace, be still.”<br/>
<br/>
When death’s dark sea we cross,<br/>
Be with us in Thy power,<br/>
Nor let the water floods prevail<br/>
In that dread trial hour.<br/>
<br/>
And, when amid the sighs,<br/>
Which speak Thine Advent near,<br/>
The roaring of the sea and waves<br/>
Fills faithless hearts with fear;<br/>
<br/>
May we all undismayed<br/>
The raging tempests see,<br/>
Lift up our head and hail with joy<br/>
Thy great Epiphany.<br/>
