<br/>
Father, the watches of the night are o’er;<br/>
To light and life the soul has ris’n once more;<br/>
Blessèd be Thou, Who, through the helpless hours,<br/>
Hast kept in deepest peace her slumbering powers.<br/>
<br/>
Father, the watches of the day are here;<br/>
More than from those of night have we to fear;<br/>
By rude cares troubled, by temptations pressed,<br/>
Through the day watches, Father, give us rest!<br/>
