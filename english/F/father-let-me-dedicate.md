title: Father Let Me Dedicate
---

---
<center>
Father, let me dedicate, all this year to Thee,<br/>
In whatever worldly state Thou wilt have me be:<br/>
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim;<br/>
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy Name.<br/>
<br/>
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?<br/>
Can a Father’s love refuse all the best to give?<br/>
More Thou givest every day than the best can claim<br/>
Nor withholdest aught that may glorify Thy Name.<br/>
<br/>
If in mercy Thou wilt spare joys that yet are mine;<br/>
If on life, serene and fair, brighter rays may shine;<br/>
Let my glad heart, while it sings, Thee in all proclaim,<br/>
And, whate’er the future brings, glorify Thy Name.<br/>
<br/>
If Thou callest to the cross, and its shadow come,<br/>
Turning all my gain to loss, shrouding heart and home;<br/>
Let me think how Thy dear Son to His glory came,<br/>
And in deepest woe pray on, “Glorify Thy Name.”
