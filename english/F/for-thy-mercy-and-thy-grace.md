<br/>
For Thy mercy and Thy grace,<br/>
Constant through another year,<br/>
Hear our song of thankfulness;<br/>
Jesus, our Redeemer, hear.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! our sins on Thee we cast,<br/>
Thee, our perfect Sacrifice;<br/>
And, forgetting all the past,<br/>
Press towards our glorious prize.<br/>
<br/>
Dark the future: let Thy light<br/>
Guide us, bright and morning Star:<br/>
Fierce our foes, and hard the fight;<br/>
Arm us, Savior, for the war.<br/>
<br/>
In our weakness and distress,<br/>
Rock of strength, be Thou our Stay;<br/>
In the pathless wilderness<br/>
Be our true and living Way.<br/>
<br/>
Who of us deathâ€™s awful road<br/>
In the coming year shall tread?<br/>
With Thy rod and staff, O God,<br/>
Comfort Thou his dying bed.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us faithful, keep us pure,<br/>
Keep us evermore Thine own;<br/>
Help, O help us to endure;<br/>
Fit us for the promised crown.<br/>
<br/>
So within Thy palace gate<br/>
We shall praise, on golden strings,<br/>
Thee the only Potentate,<br/>
Lord of lords, and King of kings.<br/>
