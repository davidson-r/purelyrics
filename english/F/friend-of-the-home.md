<br/>
Friend of the home: as when in Galilee<br/>
The mothers brought their little ones to Thee,<br/>
So we, dear Lord, would now the children bring,<br/>
And seek for them the shelter of Thy wing.<br/>
<br/>
Thine are they, by Thy love’s eternal claim,<br/>
Thine we baptize them in the threefold Name;<br/>
Yet not the sign we trust, Lord, but the grace<br/>
That in Thy fold prepared the lambs a place.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, may Thy Church, as with a mother’s care,<br/>
For Thee the lambs within her bosom bear;<br/>
And grant, as morning grows to noon, that they<br/>
Still in her love and holy service stay.<br/>
<br/>
Draw through the child the parents nearer Thee,<br/>
Endue their home with growing sanctity;<br/>
And gather all, by earthly homes made one,<br/>
In Heaven, O Christ, when earthly days are done.<br/>
