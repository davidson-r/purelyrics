<center>
Faith of our fathers, living still,<br/>
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;<br/>
O how our hearts beat high with joy<br/>
Whenever we hear that glorious Word!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!<br/>
We will be true to thee till death.<br/>
<br/>
Faith of our fathers, we will strive<br/>
To win all nations unto Thee;<br/>
And through the truth that comes from God,<br/>
We all shall then be truly free.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Faith of our fathers, we will love<br/>
Both friend and foe in all our strife;<br/>
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how<br/>
By kindly words and virtuous life.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
