<center>
Far be sorrow, tears and sighing!<br/>
Waves are calming, storms are dying,<br/>
Moses hath o’erpassed the sea,<br/>
Israel’s captive hosts are free;<br/>
Life by death slew death and saved us,<br/>
In His blood the Lamb hath saved us,<br/>
Clothing us with victory.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ from death has risen,<br/>
Lo! His Godhead bursts the prison,<br/>
While His Manhood passes free,<br/>
Vanquishing our misery.<br/>
Rise we free from condemnation;<br/>
Through our God’s humiliation,<br/>
Ours is now the victory.<br/>
<br/>
Vain the foe’s despair and madness!<br/>
See the dayspring of our gladness!<br/>
Slaves no more of Satan we;<br/>
Children, by the Son set free;<br/>
Rise, for life with death has striven,<br/>
All the snares of hell are riven,<br/>
Rise and claim the victory.
