Jesus, our Brother, strong and good,<br/>
Was humbly born in a stable rude,<br/>
And the friendly beasts around Him stood,<br/>
Jesus, our Brother, strong and good.<br/>
<br/>
“I,” said the donkey, shaggy and brown,<br/>
“I carried His mother uphill and down,<br/>
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town;<br/>
I,” said the donkey, shaggy and brown.<br/>
<br/>
“I,” said the cow, all white and red,<br/>
“I gave Him my manger for His bed,<br/>
I gave Him hay to pillow His head;<br/>
I,” said the cow, all white and red.<br/>
<br/>
“I,” said the sheep with curly horn,<br/>
“I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm,<br/>
He wore my coat on Christmas morn;<br/>
I,” said the sheep with curly horn.<br/>
<br/>
“I,” said the dove, from the rafters high,<br/>
“I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry,<br/>
We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I;<br/>
I,” said the dove, from the rafters high.<br/>
<br/>
Thus all the beasts, by some good spell,<br/>
In the stable dark were glad to tell<br/>
Of the gifts they gave Emmanuel,<br/>
The gifts they gave Emmanuel.
