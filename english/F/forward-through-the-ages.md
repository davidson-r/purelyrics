title: Forward Through The Ages

<center>
Forward through the ages, in unbroken line,<br/>
Move the faithful spirits, at the call divine;<br/>
Gifts in different measure, hearts of one accord,<br/>
Manifold the service, one the sure reward.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Forward through the ages, in unbroken line<br/>
Move the faithful spirits at the call divine.<br/>
<br/>
Wider grows the kingdom, reign of love and light;<br/>
For it we must labor, till our faith is sight.<br/>
Prophets have proclaimed it, martyrs testified.<br/>
Poets sung its glory, heroes for it died.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Not alone we conquer, not alone we fall;<br/>
In each loss or triumph lose or triumph all.<br/>
Bound by Godâ€™s far purpose in one living whole,<br/>
Move we on together to the shining goal.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
