For Thy dear saints, O Lord,<br/>
Who strove in Thee to live,<br/>
Who followed Thee, obeyed, adored,<br/>
Our grateful hymn receive.<br/>
<br/>
They all in life and death,<br/>
With Thee their Lord in view,<br/>
Learned from Thy Holy Spiritâ€™s breath<br/>
To suffer and to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thine earthly members fit<br/>
To join Thy saints above,<br/>
In one communion ever knit,<br/>
One fellowship of love.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Thy Name we bless,<br/>
And humbly pray that we<br/>
May follow them in holiness,<br/>
Who lived and died for Thee.
