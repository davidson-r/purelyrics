“From Glory unto Glory!” Be this our joyous song,<br/>
As on the King’s own highway we bravely march along!<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” O word of stirring cheer,<br/>
As dawns the solemn brightness of one more glad new year.<br/>
<br/>
Our own belovèd Master “hath many things to say.”<br/>
Look forward to His teaching, unfolding day by day;<br/>
To whispers of His Spirit, to insight clear and sweet,<br/>
To blessèd consolation, while resting at His feet.<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” Our faith hath seen the King.<br/>
We own His matchless beauty, adoringly we sing;<br/>
But He hath more to show us! O thought of untold bliss!<br/>
And on we press rejoicing in blessèd hope to this<br/>
<br/>
To marvelous outpourings of ‘treasures new and old,’<br/>
To largess of His bounty, paid in the King’s own gold,<br/>
To glorious expansion of mysteries of grace,<br/>
To radiant unveilings of brightness from His face.<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” What great things He hath done,<br/>
What wonders He hath shown us, what triumphs He hath won!<br/>
We marvel at the record of blessings of the year!<br/>
But sweeter still than Christmas rings out His promise clear<br/>
<br/>
That “greater things,” far greater, our longing eyes shall see!<br/>
We can but wait and wonder what “greater things” shall be!<br/>
But glorious fulfillments rejoicingly we claim,<br/>
While pleading in the power of His prevailing Name.<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” What mighty blessings crown<br/>
The lives for which our Lord hath laid His own so freely down!<br/>
Omnipotence to keep us, omniscience, too, to guide,<br/>
Jehovah’s blessèd presence within us to abide!<br/>
<br/>
The fullness of His blessing encompasseth our way;<br/>
The fullness of His promise crowns every brightening day;<br/>
The fullness of His glory is beaming from above,<br/>
While more and more we realize the fullness of His love.<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” Without a shade of care,<br/>
Because the Lord Who loves us will every burden bear;<br/>
Because we trust Him fully, and know that He will guide,<br/>
And know that He will keep us at His belovèd side.<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” Though tribulation fall,<br/>
It cannot touch our treasure, when Christ is All in All!<br/>
Whatever lies before us, there can be naught to fear,<br/>
For what are pain and sorrow when Jesus Christ is near?<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” O marvels of the Word!<br/>
“With open face beholding the glory of the Lord,”<br/>
We, even we (O wonder!) “are changed into the same,”<br/>
The image of our Savior, to glorify His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Abiding in His presence, and walking in the light,<br/>
And seeking to do always what is “pleasing in His sight”;<br/>
We look to Him to keep us “all glorious within,”<br/>
Because the blood of Jesus is cleansing from all sin.<br/>
<br/>
The things behind forgetting, we only gaze before<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory,” that “shineth more and more,”<br/>
Because our Lord hath said it, that such shall be our way,<br/>
(O splendor of the promise!) “unto the perfect day.”<br/>
<br/>
“From Glory unto Glory!” Our fellow travelers still<br/>
Are gathering on the journey! The bright electric thrill<br/>
Of quick, instinctive union, more frequent and more sweet,<br/>
Shall swiftly pass from heart to heart in true and tender beat.<br/>
<br/>
And closer yet, and closer, the golden bonds shall be,<br/>
Enlinking all who love our Lord in pure sincerity;<br/>
And wider yet, and wider, shall circling glory glow,<br/>
As more and more are taught our God’s mighty love to know.<br/>
<br/>
O ye who seek the Savior, look up in faith and love;<br/>
Come up into the sunshine, so bright and warm above!<br/>
No longer tread the valley, but, clinging to His hand,<br/>
Ascend the shining summits and view the glorious land.<br/>
<br/>
Our harp notes should be sweeter, our trumpet tones more clear,<br/>
Our anthems ring so grandly that all the world must hear!<br/>
O royal be our music, for who hath cause to sing<br/>
Like choruses of saved ones, the children of the King?<br/>
<br/>
O, let our adoration for all that He hath done<br/>
Peal out beyond the heavens, while voice and life are one;<br/>
And let our consecration be real, and deep, and true.<br/>
O even now our hearts bow, and joyful vows renew!<br/>
<br/>
“In full and glad surrender we give ourselves to Thee,<br/>
Thine utterly, and only, and evermore to be!<br/>
O Son of God, Who lov’st us, we will be Thine alone,<br/>
Our being and possessions, shall henceforth be Thine own!”<br/>
<br/>
Now onward, ever onward, “from strength to strength” we go,<br/>
While “grace for grace” abundant shall from His fullness flow,<br/>
To glory’s full fruition, from glory’s foretaste here,<br/>
Until His very presence crown happiest new year.
