From Heaven above to earth I come,<br/>
To bear good news to every home;<br/>
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,<br/>
Whereof I now will say and sing.<br/>
<br/>
To you, this night, is born a Child<br/>
Of Mary, chosen mother mild;<br/>
This tender Child of lowly birth,<br/>
Shall be the joy of all your earth.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis Christ our God, Who far on high<br/>
Had heard your sad and bitter cry;<br/>
Himself will your Salvation be,<br/>
Himself from sin will make you free.<br/>
<br/>
He brings those blessings long ago<br/>
Prepared by God for all below;<br/>
That in His heavenly kingdom blest<br/>
You may with us forever rest.<br/>
<br/>
These are the tokens ye shall mark,<br/>
The swaddling clothes and manger dark;<br/>
There shall ye find the young Child laid,<br/>
By Whom the heavens and earth were made.<br/>
<br/>
Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,<br/>
Follow the shepherds, and draw near<br/>
To see this wondrous Gift of God,<br/>
Who hath His own dear Son bestowed.<br/>
<br/>
Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!<br/>
What is it in yon manger lies?<br/>
Who is this Child, so young and fair?<br/>
The blessèd Christ Child lieth there!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,<br/>
Through Whom e’en wicked men are blest!<br/>
Thou com’st to share our misery,<br/>
What can we render, Lord, to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Lord, Who hast created all,<br/>
How hast Thou made Thee weak and small,<br/>
To lie upon the coarse dry grass,<br/>
The food of humble ox and ass.<br/>
<br/>
Were earth a thousand times as fair,<br/>
Beset with gold and jewels rare,<br/>
She yet were far too poor to be<br/>
A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
For velvets soft and silken stuff<br/>
Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,<br/>
Whereon Thou King, so rich and great,<br/>
As ’twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.<br/>
<br/>
Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain<br/>
The truth to us, poor fools and vain,<br/>
That this world’s honor, wealth and might<br/>
Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,<br/>
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,<br/>
Here in my poor heart’s inmost shrine,<br/>
That I may evermore be Thine.<br/>
<br/>
My heart for very joy doth leap,<br/>
My lips no more can silence keep,<br/>
I too must sing, with joyful tongue,<br/>
That sweetest ancient cradle song.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God in highest Heaven,<br/>
Who unto man His Son hath given,<br/>
While angels sing, with pious mirth,<br/>
A glad New Year to all the earth.
