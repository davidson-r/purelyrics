<br/>
Father, Most High, be with us,<br/>
Unseen, Thy goodness showing,<br/>
And Christ the Word Incarnate,<br/>
And Spirit grace bestowing.<br/>
O Trinity, O Oneness<br/>
Of light and power exceeding;<br/>
O God of God Eternal<br/>
O God, from Both proceeding!<br/>
<br/>
While daylight hours are passing,<br/>
We live and work before Thee;<br/>
Now, ere we rest in slumber,<br/>
We gather to adore Thee.<br/>
Our Christian name and calling<br/>
Of our new birth remind us;<br/>
The Spirit’s gifts and sealing<br/>
To firm obedience bind us.<br/>
<br/>
Begone, ye powers of evil<br/>
With snares and wiles unholy!<br/>
Disturb not with your temptings<br/>
The spirits of the lowly.<br/>
Depart! for Christ is present,<br/>
Beside us, yea, within us;<br/>
Away! His sign, ye know it,<br/>
The victory shall win us.<br/>
<br/>
Awhile the body resteth;<br/>
The spirit, wakeful ever,<br/>
Abideth in communion<br/>
With Christ, Who sleepeth never,<br/>
To God, th’Eternal Father,<br/>
To Christ, our sure salvation,<br/>
To God, the Holy Spirit,<br/>
Be endless adoration.<br/>
