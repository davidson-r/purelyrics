<br/>
Father, Whose love we have wronged by transgression,<br/>
Christ, Who wast nailed for our sins on the tree,<br/>
Spirit, Who givest the grace of repentance;<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, adorable Savior of sinners,<br/>
Author of penitence, Hope of our souls,<br/>
Plentiful Fountain of grace and compassion;<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who didst empty Thyself of Thy glory,<br/>
Thou Who Thy parents on earth didst obey,<br/>
Thou Who for our sake enduredst temptation,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who hast shown us the love of the Father,<br/>
Meeting with mercy the prodigal son,<br/>
Sonship and home to the lost one restoring,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, Who once by the well to the sinner<br/>
Clearly the sins of her heart did reveal,<br/>
Leading her gently to faith and repentance,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who didst enter the house of Zaccheus,<br/>
Blessing his faith and accepting his love,<br/>
When for wrongdoing he made restitution,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Christ, with the Twelve the last Passover keeping,<br/>
Ere on the cross the true Lamb should be slain,<br/>
Sacrifice offered for all and for ever,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, alone with the blood-sweat upon Thee,<br/>
Jesu, in agony bowed to the earth,<br/>
Jesu, Thy will to the Father resigning,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, from Annas to Caiaphas hurried,<br/>
Blindfolded, stricken, and falsely accused,<br/>
Rudely blasphemed, and declared a blasphemer,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, denied by Thine eager Apostle,<br/>
Whom with a look Thou didst straightway recall,<br/>
Moving him straightway to tears and contrition;<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who wast wounded to heal our transgression,<br/>
Lifted on high to draw all men to Thee,<br/>
There on the cross in Thy majesty reigning,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
That Thou wouldst draw us to heartfelt contrition,<br/>
That Thou wouldst help us our sins to confess,<br/>
That Thou wouldst grant us the grace of amendment,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
That we may bring forth works meet for repentance,<br/>
That we give place to the devil no more,<br/>
That Thou wouldst lead us to sure perseverance,<br/>
Hear us, we pray Thee, good Lord.<br/>
