Fain would I, Lord of grace,<br/>
With penitential tears<br/>
The record of my sins efface,<br/>
That in Thy book appears:<br/>
<br/>
Fain would I journey hence,<br/>
In garb of stainless white,<br/>
And made by mine own penitence<br/>
Well pleasing in Thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
Fond idle dream! the foe<br/>
But lures and fools my soul;<br/>
Not all my tears can peace bestowâ€”<br/>
Thou only makest whole.<br/>
<br/>
Hath ever sailor tossed,<br/>
Or sufferer racked in pain,<br/>
Within Thine anchorage been lost,<br/>
Or found Thy Gilead vain?<br/>
<br/>
Maker and Hope of all!<br/>
Wounded and sick am I:<br/>
Great Healer, save me, lest I fall<br/>
And perish utterly.<br/>
<br/>
Can boundless love reject?<br/>
Shall mercy say me nay,<br/>
Who cry with all Thine own elect<br/>
Before Thee, night and day?
