title: For Those We Love Within The Veil

<center>
For those we love within the veil,<br/>
Who once were comrades of our way,<br/>
We thank Thee, Lord; for they have won<br/>
To cloudless day.<br/>
<br/>
And life for them is life indeed,<br/>
The splendid goal of earthâ€™s strait race;<br/>
And where no shadows intervene<br/>
They see Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
Not as we knew them any more,<br/>
Toil worn, and sad with burdened care:<br/>
Erect, clear eyed, upon their brows<br/>
Thy Name they bear.<br/>
<br/>
Free from the fret of mortal years,<br/>
And knowing now Thy perfect will,<br/>
With quickened sense and heightened joy,<br/>
They serve Thee still.<br/>
<br/>
O fuller, sweeter is that life,<br/>
And larger, ampler is the air:<br/>
Eye cannot see nor heart conceive<br/>
The glory there;<br/>
<br/>
Nor know to what high purpose Thou<br/>
Dost yet employ their ripened powers,<br/>
Nor how at Thy behest they touch<br/>
This life of ours.<br/>
<br/>
There are no tears within their eyes;<br/>
With love they keep perpetual tryst;<br/>
And praise and work and rest are one<br/>
With Thee, O Christ.
