<br/>
Forty days and forty nights<br/>
Thou wast fasting in the wild;<br/>
Forty days and forty nights<br/>
Tempted, and yet undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
Sunbeams scorching all the day;<br/>
Chilly dew-drops nightly shed;<br/>
Prowling beasts about Thy way;<br/>
Stones Thy pillow; earth Thy bed.<br/>
<br/>
Should not we Thy sorrow share<br/>
And from worldly joys abstain,<br/>
Fasting with unceasing prayer,<br/>
Strong with Thee to suffer pain?<br/>
<br/>
Then if Satan on us press,<br/>
Jesus, Savior, hear our call!<br/>
Victor in the wilderness,<br/>
Grant we may not faint nor fall!<br/>
<br/>
So shall we have peace divine:<br/>
Holier gladness ours shall be;<br/>
Round us, too, shall angels shine,<br/>
Such as ministered to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Keep, O keep us, Savior dear,<br/>
Ever constant by Thy side;<br/>
That with Thee we may appear<br/>
At the eternal Eastertide.<br/>
