title: Fast As Taught By Holy Lore
---

<center>
The fast, as taught by holy lore,<br/>
We keep in solemn course once more;<br/>
The fast to all men known, and bound<br/>
In forty days of yearly round.<br/>
<br/>
The law and seers that were of old<br/>
In divers ways this Lent foretold<br/>
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,<br/>
In after ages sanctified.<br/>
<br/>
More sparing therefore let us make<br/>
The words we speak, the food we take,<br/>
Our sleep and mirth, and closer barred<br/>
Be every sense in holy guard.<br/>
<br/>
In prayer together let us fall,<br/>
And cry for mercy, one and all,<br/>
And weep before the Judge’s feet,<br/>
And His avenging wrath entreat.<br/>
<br/>
Thy grace have we offended sore,<br/>
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br/>
But pour upon us from on high,<br/>
O pardoning One, Thy clemency.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Thou, though frail we be,<br/>
That yet Thine handiwork are we;<br/>
Nor let the honor of Thy Name<br/>
Be by another put to shame.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;<br/>
Increase the good that we have sought;<br/>
That we at length, our wanderings o’er,<br/>
May please Thee here and evermore.<br/>
<br/>
We pray Thee, holy Trinity,<br/>
One God, unchanging Unity,<br/>
That we from this our abstinence<br/>
May reap the fruits of penitence.
