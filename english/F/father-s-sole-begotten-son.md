The Father’s sole begotten Son<br/>
Was born, the virgin’s Child, on earth;<br/>
His cross for us adoption won,<br/>
The life and grace of second birth.<br/>
<br/>
Forth from the height of Heav’n He came,<br/>
In form of man with man abode;<br/>
Redeemed His world from death and shame,<br/>
The joys of endless life bestowed.<br/>
<br/>
Redeemer, come with power benign,<br/>
Dwell in the souls that look for Thee;<br/>
O let Thy light within us shine<br/>
That we may Thy salvation see.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us, O Lord, we pray,<br/>
Dispel the gloom of doubt and woe;<br/>
Wash every stain of guilt away,<br/>
Thy tender healing grace bestow.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, Thou hast come, and well we know<br/>
That Thou wilt likewise come again;<br/>
Thy kingdom shield from every foe,<br/>
Thy honor and Thy rule maintain.<br/>
<br/>
Eternal glory, Lord, to Thee,<br/>
Whom, now revealed, our hearts adore;<br/>
To God the Father glory be,<br/>
And Holy Spirit evermore.
