title: For The Deep Love That Kept Us

<center>
For the deep love that kept us through the night,<br/>
And gave our senses to sleep’s gentle sway;<br/>
For this new wonder of morning’s dawning light,<br/>
Flushing the east with prophecies of day,<br/>
We thank Thee, O our God.<br/>
<br/>
For the fresh life that through our being flows,<br/>
With its full tide to enrich and to bless;<br/>
For calm, sweet thoughts, upspringing from repose,<br/>
To bear to Thee our song of thankfulness,<br/>
We praise Thee, O our God.<br/>
<br/>
Day utters speech to day, and night to night<br/>
Tells of Thy glory and power. So would we<br/>
Thy children, duly, with morning’s golden light,<br/>
Or still at eve, upon the bended knee,<br/>
Adore Thee, O our God.<br/>
<br/>
Thou knowest our needs, Thy fullness will supply;<br/>
Our blindness, Thy hand will still lead us on;<br/>
Till we shall see the Dayspring from on high,<br/>
Our prayer, one only, “Let Thy will be done,”<br/>
We breathe to Thee, O God.
