<center>
Father of spirits, Whose divine control<br/>
Doth bind the soul and body into one;<br/>
Thou wilt restore this body now undone;<br/>
For once it was the mansion of a soul,<br/>
Where dwelt the glowing wisdom of Thy Son.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Maker of the body, dost ordain<br/>
That this Thine image, molded by Thy will,<br/>
Our every hope in glory shall fulfill;<br/>
So, till the body Thou dost build again,<br/>
Thou wilt preserve the spirit freed from ill.<br/>
<br/>
In that blest region shall this spirit dwell<br/>
Where flowers undying bloom on every side:<br/>
For lo, we trust Thy Word, O Crucified,<br/>
When in Thy triumph over death and hell,<br/>
The thief forgiven took Thee for his Guide.<br/>
<br/>
Our brother goeth by the shining way,<br/>
That ever to the faithful open lies:<br/>
Lord, train Thy servant now in Paradise,<br/>
And bless him in his fatherland, we pray,<br/>
Till Thou shalt bid his body to arise.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
Our sister goeth by the shining way,<br/>
That ever to the faithful open lies:<br/>
Lord, train Thy servant now in Paradise,<br/>
And bless her in her fatherland, we pray,<br/>
Till Thou shalt bid her body to arise.
