O Flower of Scotland, <br/>
When will we see <br/>
Your like again, <br/>
That fought and died for, <br/>
Your wee bit Hill and Glen, <br/>
And stood against him, <br/>
Proud Edward's Army, <br/>
And sent him homeward, <br/>
Tae think again. <br/>
The Hills are bare now, <br/>
And Autumn leaves <br/>
Lie thick and still, <br/>
O'er land that is lost now, <br/>
Which those so dearly held, <br/>
That stood against him, <br/>
Proud Edward's Army, <br/>
And sent him homeward, <br/>
Tae think again. <br/>
Those days are past now, <br/>
And in the past <br/>
They must remain, <br/>
But we can still rise now, <br/>
And be the nation again, <br/>
That stood against him, <br/>
Proud Edward's Army, <br/>
And sent him homeward, <br/>
Tae think again. <br/>
O Flower of Scotland, <br/>
When will we see <br/>

Your wee bit Hill and Glen, <br/>
And stood against him, <br/>
Proud Edward's Army, <br/>
And sent him homeward, <br/>
Tae think again.
