From lands that see the sun arise,<br/>
To earth’s remotest boundaries,<br/>
The virgin born today we sing,<br/>
The Son of Mary, Christ the King.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Author of this earthly frame,<br/>
To take a servant’s form He came,<br/>
That liberating flesh by flesh,<br/>
Whom He had made might live afresh.<br/>
<br/>
In that chaste parent’s holy womb,<br/>
Celestial grace hath found its home:<br/>
And she, as earthly bride unknown,<br/>
Yet call that Offspring blest her own.<br/>
<br/>
The mansion of the modest breast<br/>
Becomes a shrine where God shall rest:<br/>
The pure and undefiled one<br/>
Conceived in her womb the Son.<br/>
<br/>
That Son, that royal Son she bore,<br/>
Whom Gabriel’s voice had told afore:<br/>
Whom, in his Mother yet concealed,<br/>
The Infant Baptist had revealed.<br/>
<br/>
The manger and the straw He bore,<br/>
The cradle did He not abhor:<br/>
A little milk His infant fare<br/>
Who feedeth even each fowl of air.<br/>
<br/>
The heavenly chorus filled the sky,<br/>
The angels sang to God on high,<br/>
What time to shepherds watching lone<br/>
They made creation’s Shepherd known.<br/>
<br/>
All honor, laud, and glory be,<br/>
O Jesu, virgin born, to Thee;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To the Father and to Paraclete.
