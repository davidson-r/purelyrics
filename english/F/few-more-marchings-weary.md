title: Few More Marchings Weary

<center>
A few more marchings weary, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more storm clouds dreary, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more days the cross to bear,<br/>
And then with Christ a crown to wear;<br/>
A few more marchings weary, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O’er time’s rapid river, soon we’ll rest forever;<br/>
No more marchings weary when we gather home!<br/>
<br/>
A few more nights of weeping, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more watches keeping, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more vict’ries over sin,<br/>
A few more sheaves to gather in,<br/>
A few more marchings weary, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A few more sweet links broken, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more kind words spoken, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
A few more partings on the strand,<br/>
And then away to Canaan’s land:<br/>
A few more marchings weary, then we’ll gather home!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
