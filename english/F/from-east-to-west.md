title: From East to West

From east to west, from shore to shore,<br/>
Let every heart awake and sing<br/>
The holy Child Whom Mary bore,<br/>
The Christ, the everlasting King.<br/>
<br/>
Behold, the world’s Creator wears<br/>
The form and fashion of a slave;<br/>
Our very flesh our Maker shares,<br/>
His fallen creature, man, to save.<br/>
<br/>
For this how wondrously He wrought!<br/>
A maiden, in her lowly place,<br/>
Became, in ways beyond all thought,<br/>
The chosen vessel of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
She bowed her to the angel’s word<br/>
Declaring what the Father willed,<br/>
And suddenly the promised Lord<br/>
That pure and hallowed temple filled.<br/>
<br/>
He shrank not from the oxen’s stall,<br/>
He lay within the manger bed,<br/>
And He whose bounty feedeth all<br/>
At Mary’s breast Himself was fed.<br/>
<br/>
And while the angels in the sky<br/>
Sang praise above the silent field,<br/>
To shepherds poor the Lord Most High,<br/>
The one great Shepherd, was revealed.<br/>
<br/>
All glory for this blessèd morn<br/>
To God the Father ever be;<br/>
All praise to Thee, O virgin born,<br/>
All praise, O Holy Ghost, to Thee.
