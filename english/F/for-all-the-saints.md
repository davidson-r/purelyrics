<br/>
For all the saints, who from their labors rest,<br/>
who thee by faith before the world confessed,<br/>
thy Name, O Jesus, be forever blessed.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might;<br/>
thou, Lord, their Captain in the well fought fight;<br/>
thou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
For the apostles' glorious company,<br/>
who bearing forth the cross o'er land and sea,<br/>
shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee:<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
For the Evangelists, by whose blest word,<br/>
like fourfold streams, the garden of the Lord,<br/>
is fair and fruitful, be thy Name adored.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
For Martyrs, who with rapture kindled eye,<br/>
saw the bright crown descending from the sky,<br/>
and seeing, grasped it, thee we glorify.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,<br/>
fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,<br/>
and win, with them the victor's crown of gold.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
O blest communion, fellowship divine!<br/>
we feebly struggle, they in glory shine;<br/>
all are one in thee, for all are thine.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,<br/>
steals on the ear the distant triumph song,<br/>
and hearts are brave, again, and arms are strong.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
The golden evening brightens in the west;<br/>
soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;<br/>
sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;<br/>
the saints triumphant rise in bright array;<br/>
the King of glory passes on his way.<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,<br/>
through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,<br/>
and singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost:<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia!Â  <br/>
