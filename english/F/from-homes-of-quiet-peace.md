From homes of quiet peace<br/>
We lift up hands of prayer,<br/>
And those Thou gavest us to love<br/>
Commend, Lord, to Thy care.<br/>
<br/>
In perils of the sea<br/>
Watch o’er them day by day;<br/>
In perils of the common life<br/>
Be Thou their Strength and Stay.<br/>
<br/>
Let Thine almighty arm<br/>
Be their defense and shield;<br/>
And whosoever’s cause is Thine<br/>
To them the victory yield.
