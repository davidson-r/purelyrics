<br/>
For the beauty of the earth<br/>
For the glory of the skies,<br/>
For the love which from our birth<br/>
Over and around us lies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lord of all, to Thee we raise,<br/>
This our hymn of grateful praise.<br/>
<br/>
For the beauty of each hour,<br/>
Of the day and of the night,<br/>
Hill and vale, and tree and flower,<br/>
Sun and moon, and stars of light.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For the joy of ear and eye,<br/>
For the heart and mind’s delight,<br/>
For the mystic harmony<br/>
Linking sense to sound and sight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For the joy of human love,<br/>
Brother, sister, parent, child,<br/>
Friends on earth and friends above,<br/>
For all gentle thoughts and mild.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For Thy Church, that evermore<br/>
Lifteth holy hands above,<br/>
Offering up on every shore<br/>
Her pure sacrifice of love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For the martyrs’ crown of light,<br/>
For Thy prophets’ eagle eye,<br/>
For Thy bold confessors’ might,<br/>
For the lips of infancy.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For Thy virgins’ robes of snow,<br/>
For Thy maiden mother mild,<br/>
For Thyself, with hearts aglow,<br/>
Jesu, Victim undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For each perfect gift of Thine,<br/>
To our race so freely given,<br/>
Graces human and divine,<br/>
Flowers of earth and buds of Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
