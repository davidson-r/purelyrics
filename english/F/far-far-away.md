Far, far away on Judeaâ€™s plains,<br/>
Shepherds of old heard the joyous strains:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God, glory to God,<br/>
Glory to God in the highest;<br/>
Peace on earth, good will to men;<br/>
Peace on earth, good will to men.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet are these strains of redeeming love,<br/>
Message of mercy from heaven above:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lord, with the angels we too would rejoice;<br/>
Help us to sing with the heart and voice:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hasten the time when, from every clime,<br/>
Men shall unite in the strains sublime:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
