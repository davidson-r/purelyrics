<br/>
From heaven high, O angels, come,<br/>
Eya, eya, susani, susani, susani.<br/>
Come music, song, come pipe and drum,<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia.<br/>
Of Jesus sing and Maria.<br/>
<br/>
Let every instrument join in, <br/>
Eya, eya, susani, susani, susani.<br/>
Bring lute and harp and violin,<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia.<br/>
Of Jesus sing and Maria.<br/>
<br/>
Send forth your voices louder yet,<br/>
Eya, eya, susani, susani, susani. <br/>
With organ and with flageolet,<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia.<br/>
Of Jesus sing and Maria.<br/>
<br/>
How heavenly must the music be, <br/>
Eya, eya, susani, susani, susani.<br/>
Because a heavenly Child is He,<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia.<br/>
Of Jesus sing and Maria.<br/>
<br/>
To men on earth all peace may be, <br/>
Eya, eya, susani, susani, susani. <br/>
And praise to God eternally,<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia.<br/>
Of Jesus sing and Maria.<br/>
