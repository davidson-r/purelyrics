<br/>
Father, God, we glorify<br/>
Thy love to Adam’s seed;<br/>
Love that gave Thy Son to die,<br/>
And raised Him from the dead:<br/>
Him, for our offenses slain,<br/>
That we all might pardon find,<br/>
Thou hast brought to life again,<br/>
The Savior of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
By Thy own right hand of power<br/>
Thou hast exalted Him,<br/>
Sent the mighty Conqueror<br/>
Thy people to redeem:<br/>
King of Saints, and Prince of Peace,<br/>
Him Thou hast for sinners giv’n,<br/>
Sinners from their sins to bless,<br/>
And lift them up to Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Father, God, to us impart<br/>
The gift unspeakable;<br/>
Now in every waiting heart<br/>
Thy glorious Son reveal:<br/>
Quickened with our living Lord,<br/>
Let us in Thy Spirit rise,<br/>
Rise to all Thy life restored,<br/>
And bless Thee in the skies.<br/>
