<br/>
From the eastern mountains, pressing on, they come,<br/>
Wise men in their wisdom, to His humble home;<br/>
Stirred by deep devotion, hasting from afar,<br/>
Ever journeying onward, guided by a star.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Light of life that shineth ere the worlds began,<br/>
Draw Thou near, and lighten every heart of man.<br/>
<br/>
There their Lord and Savior meek and lowly lay,<br/>
Wondrous Light that led them onward on their way,<br/>
Ever now to lighten nations from afar,<br/>
As they journey homeward by that guiding star.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who in a manger once hast lowly lain,<br/>
Who dost now in glory o’er all kingdoms reign,<br/>
Gather in the heathen who in lands afar<br/>
Ne’er have seen the brightness of Thy guiding star.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gather in the outcasts, all who’ve gone astray,<br/>
Throw Thy radiance o’er them, guide them on their way.<br/>
Those who never knew Thee, those who’ve wandered far,<br/>
Guide them by the brightness of Thy guiding star.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Onward through the darkness of the lonely night,<br/>
Shining still before them with Thy kindly light.<br/>
Guide them, Jew and Gentile, homeward from afar,<br/>
Young and old together, by Thy guiding Star.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Until every nation, whether bond or free,<br/>
’Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus, follows Thee.<br/>
O’er the distant mountains to that heavenly home,<br/>
Where nor sin nor sorrow evermore shall come.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
