<br/>
All my doubts I give to Jesus!<br/>
I’ve His gracious promise heard—<br/>
“I shall never be confounded”—<br/>
I am trusting in that word.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I am trusting, fully trusting,<br/>
Sweetly trusting in His Word;<br/>
I am trusting, fully trusting,<br/>
Sweetly trusting in His Word.<br/>
<br/>
All my sin I lay on Jesus!<br/>
He doth wash me in His blood;<br/>
He will keep me pure and holy,<br/>
He will bring me home to God.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All my fears I give to Jesus!<br/>
Rests my weary soul on Him;<br/>
Tho’ my way be hid in darkness,<br/>
Never can His light grow dim.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All my joys I give to Jesus!<br/>
He is all I want of bliss;<br/>
He of all the worlds is Master—<br/>
He has all I need in this.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All I am I give to Jesus!<br/>
All my body, all my soul,<br/>
All I have, and all I hope for,<br/>
While eternal ages roll.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
