<br/>
How painfully pleasing the fond recollection<br/>
Of youthful connections and innocent joy!<br/>
When blest with parental advice and affection;<br/>
Surrounded with mercies, with peace from on high.<br/>
I still view the chairs of my sire and my mother,<br/>
The seats of their offspring as ranged on each hand;<br/>
And that richest of books, which excelled every other,<br/>
The family Bible, which lay on the stand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The old fashioned Bible, the dear, blessèd Bible,<br/>
The family Bible which lay on the stand.<br/>
<br/>
That Bible, the volume of God’s inspiration,<br/>
At noon and at evening could give us delight;<br/>
And the prayer of our sire was a sweet invocation,<br/>
For mercy by day and for safety thro’ night;<br/>
Our hymns of thanksgiving with harmony swelling<br/>
All warm from the hearts of that family band,<br/>
Half raised us from earth to that rapturous dwelling<br/>
Described in the Bible that lay on the stand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Ye scenes of tranquility! long have we parted;<br/>
My hope’s almost gone, and my parents no more;<br/>
In sorrow and sadness I live broken-hearted,<br/>
And wander unknown on a far distant shore;<br/>
Yet, how can I doubt my dear Savior’s protection,<br/>
Forgetful of gifts from His bountiful hand!<br/>
Oh! let me with patience endure His correction,<br/>
And think of the Bible that lay on the stand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
