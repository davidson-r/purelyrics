<br/>
Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,<br/>
O Thou of God and man the Son,<br/>
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,<br/>
Thou, my soulâ€™s glory, joy and crown.<br/>
<br/>
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,<br/>
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;<br/>
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,<br/>
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.<br/>
<br/>
Fair is the sunshine,<br/>
Fairer still the moonlight,<br/>
And all the twinkling starry host;<br/>
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer<br/>
Than all the angels heaven can boast.<br/>
<br/>
All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly,<br/>
Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;<br/>
None can be nearer, fairer or dearer,<br/>
Than Thou, my Savior, art to me.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!<br/>
Son of God and Son of Man!<br/>
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,<br/>
Now and forever more be Thine.<br/>
