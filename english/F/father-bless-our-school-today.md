<br/>
Father, bless our school today;<br/>
Be in all we do and say;<br/>
Be in every song we sing,<br/>
Every prayer to Thee we bring.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, well belovèd Son,<br/>
May Thy will by us be done;<br/>
Come and meet with us today;<br/>
Teach us, Lord, Thyself, we pray.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Spirit, mighty power,<br/>
Consecrate this Lord’s day hour;<br/>
Unto us Thine unction give;<br/>
Touch our souls that we may live.<br/>
