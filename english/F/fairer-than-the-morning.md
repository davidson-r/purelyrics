title: Fairer than the morning

<center>
Thou art fairer than the morning,<br/>
O my Savior and my King!<br/>
Of Thy grandeur and Thy beauty,<br/>
How my soul delights to sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou art fairer than the morning,<br/>
Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;<br/>
At the glory of Thy presence<br/>
Clouds and darkness flee away.<br/>
<br/>
Clothed in light as with a garment,<br/>
Crowned with majesty divine,<br/>
Lo, the scepter of dominion<br/>
Now and ever, Lord, is Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the greatness of Thy mercy,<br/>
And the richness of Thy grace!<br/>
Oh, the love that in Thy kingdom<br/>
Is preparing me a place!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When the silver cord is broken,<br/>
And this mortal life is oâ€™er,<br/>
With ten thousand times ten thousand,<br/>
I shall sing for evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
