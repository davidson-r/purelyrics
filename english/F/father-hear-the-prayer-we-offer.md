title: Father Hear The Prayer We Offer

<br/>
Father, hear the prayer we offer:<br/>
Not for ease that prayer shall be,<br/>
But for strength that we may ever<br/>
Live our lives courageously.<br/>
<br/>
Not for ever in green pastures<br/>
Do we ask our way to be;<br/>
But the steep and rugged pathway<br/>
May we tread rejoicingly.<br/>
<br/>
Not for ever by still waters<br/>
Would we idly rest and stay;<br/>
But would smith the living fountains<br/>
From the rocks along our way.<br/>
<br/>
Be our strength in hours of weakness,<br/>
In our wanderings be our guide;<br/>
Through endeavour, failure, danger,<br/>
Father, be thou at our side.<br/>
