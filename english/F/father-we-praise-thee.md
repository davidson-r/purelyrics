<center>
Father, we praise Thee, now the night is over;<br/>
Active and watchful, stand we all before Thee;<br/>
Singing, we offer, prayer and meditation;<br/>
Thus we adore Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Monarch of all things, fit us for Thy mansions;<br/>
Banish our weakness, health and wholeness sending;<br/>
Bring us to Heaven, where Thy saints united<br/>
Joy without ending.<br/>
<br/>
All holy Father, Son and equal Spirit,<br/>
Trinity bless√®d, send us Thy salvation;<br/>
Thine is the glory, gleaming and resounding<br/>
Through all creation.
