<br/>
Father of Jesus Christ, my Lord,<br/>
My Savior and my Head;<br/>
I trust in Thee, Whose powerful Word<br/>
Hath raised Him from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
In hope, against all human hope,<br/>
Self desperate, I believe;<br/>
Thy quickening Word shall raise me up,<br/>
Thou shalt Thy Spirit give.<br/>
<br/>
Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees,<br/>
And looks to that alone;<br/>
Laughs at impossibilities,<br/>
And cries, “It shall be done!”<br/>
<br/>
To Thee the glory of Thy power<br/>
And faithfulness I give;<br/>
I shall in Christ, at that glad hour,<br/>
And Christ in me shall live.<br/>
<br/>
Obedient faith that waits on Thee,<br/>
Thou never wilt reprove;<br/>
Bt Thou wilt form Thy Son in me,<br/>
And perfect me in love.<br/>
