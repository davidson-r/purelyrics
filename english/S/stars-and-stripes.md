<br/>
Let martial note in triumph float<br/>
And liberty extend its mighty hand<br/>
A flag appears 'mid thunderous cheers,<br/>
The banner of the Western land.<br/>
The emblem of the brave and true<br/>
Its folds protect no tyrant crew;<br/>
The red and white and starry blue<br/>
Is freedom's shield and hope.<br/>
Other nations may deem their flags the best<br/>
And cheer them with fervid elation<br/>
But the flag of the North and South and West<br/>
Is the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.<br/>
<br/>
Hurrah for the flag of the free!<br/>
May it wave as our standard forever,<br/>
The gem of the land and the sea,<br/>
The banner of the right.<br/>
Let despots remember the day<br/>
When our fathers with mighty endeavor<br/>
Proclaimed as they marched to the fray<br/>
That by their might and by their right<br/>
It waves forever.<br/>
<br/>
Let eagle shriek from lofty peak<br/>
The never-ending watchword of our land;<br/>
Let summer breeze waft through the trees<br/>
The echo of the chorus grand.<br/>
Sing out for liberty and light,<br/>
Sing out for freedom and the right.<br/>
Sing out for Union and its might,<br/>
O patriotic sons.<br/>
Other nations may deem their flags the best<br/>
And cheer them with fervid elation,<br/>
But the flag of the North and South and West<br/>
Is the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.<br/>
<br/>
Hurrah for the flag of the free.<br/>
May it wave as our standard forever<br/>
The gem of the land and the sea,<br/>
The banner of the right.<br/>
Let despots remember the day<br/>
When our fathers with might endeavor<br/>
Proclaimed as they marched to the fray,<br/>
That by their might and by their right<br/>
It waves forever.<br/>
