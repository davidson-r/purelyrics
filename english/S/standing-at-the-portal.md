Standing at the portal<br/>
Of the opening year,<br/>
Words of comfort meet us,<br/>
Hushing every fear;<br/>
Spoken thru the silence<br/>
By our Savior’s voice,<br/>
Tender, strong and faithful,<br/>
Making us rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Onward, then, and fear not,<br/>
Children of the day;<br/>
For His Word shall never,<br/>
Never pass away.<br/>
<br/>
“I, the Lord, am with thee,<br/>
Be thou not afraid;<br/>
I will help and strengthen<br/>
Be thou not dismayed.<br/>
Yea, I will uphold thee<br/>
With My own right hand;<br/>
Thou art called and chosen<br/>
In My sight to stand.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For the year before us,<br/>
O what rich supplies!<br/>
For the poor and needy<br/>
Living streams shall rise;<br/>
For the sad and sinful<br/>
Shall His grace abound;<br/>
For the faint and feeble<br/>
Perfect strength be found.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He will never fail us,<br/>
He will not forsake;<br/>
For His eternal covenant<br/>
He will never break.<br/>
Resting on the promise,<br/>
What have we to fear?<br/>
God is all sufficient<br/>
For the coming year.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
