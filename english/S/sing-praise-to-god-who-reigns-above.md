<br/>
Rejoice, ye pure in heart!<br/>
Rejoice, give thanks and sing!<br/>
Your glorious banner wave on high,<br/>
the cross of Christ your King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice, <br/>
rejoice, give thanks and sing.<br/>
<br/>
Bright youth and snow crowned age,<br/>
strong men and maidens meek,<br/>
raise high your free, exultant song,<br/>
God's wondrous praises speak. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yes onward, onward still<br/>
with hymn, and chant and song,<br/>
through gate, and porch and columned aisle,<br/>
the hallowed pathways throng. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With all the angel choirs,<br/>
with all the saints of earth,<br/>
pour out the strains of joy and bliss,<br/>
true rapture, noblest mirth. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Your clear hosannas raise;<br/>
and alleluias loud;<br/>
whilst answering echoes upward float,<br/>
Llke wreaths of incense cloud. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With voice as full and strong<br/>
as ocean's surging praise,<br/>
send forth the hymns our fathers loved,<br/>
the psalms of ancient days. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yes, on through life's long path,<br/>
still chanting as ye go;<br/>
from youth to age, by night and day,<br/>
in gladness and in woe. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Still lift your standard high,<br/>
still march in firm array,<br/>
as warriors through the darkness toil,<br/>
till dawns the golden day. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
At last the march shall end;<br/>
the wearied ones shall rest;<br/>
the pilgrims find their heavenly home,<br/>
Jerusalem the blessed. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then on, ye pure in heart!<br/>
Rejoice, give thanks and sing!<br/>
Your glorious banner wave on high,<br/>
the cross of Christ your King. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Praise God who reigns on high,<br/>
the Lord whom we adore,<br/>
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,<br/>
one God forevermore. Refrain<br/>
