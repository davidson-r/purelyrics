<br/>
The snow lay on the ground,<br/>
The stars shone bright,<br/>
When Christ our Lord was born<br/>
On Christmas night.<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum;<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum;<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum;<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum;<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum;<br/>
<br/>
’Twas Mary, daughter pure<br/>
Of holy Anne,<br/>
That brought into this world<br/>
The God made man.<br/>
She laid Him in a stall<br/>
At Bethlehem;<br/>
The ass and oxen shared<br/>
The roof with them.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Saint Joseph, too, was by<br/>
To tend the Child;<br/>
To guard him, and protect<br/>
His mother mild;<br/>
The angels hovered round,<br/>
And sung this song,<br/>
Venite adoremus Dominum.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And thus that manger poor<br/>
Became a throne;<br/>
For He Whom Mary bore<br/>
Was God the Son.<br/>
O come, then, let us join<br/>
The heav’nly host,<br/>
To praise the Father, Son,<br/>
And Holy Ghost.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
