<br/>
Since Jesus freely did appear<br/>
To grace a marriage feast<br/>
O Lord, we ask Thy presence here,<br/>
To make a wedding Guest.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the bridal pair look down,<br/>
Who now have plighted hands;<br/>
Their union with Thy favor crown,<br/>
And bless the nuptial bands.<br/>
<br/>
With gifts of grace their hearts endow,<br/>
Of all rich dowries blest;<br/>
Their substance bless, and peace bestow,<br/>
To sweeten all the rest.<br/>
<br/>
In purest love their souls unite,<br/>
That they with Christian care,<br/>
May make domestic burdens light,<br/>
By taking mutual share.<br/>
