<br/>
Sweeter sounds than music knows<br/>
Charm me, in Emmanuel’s Name;<br/>
All her hopes my spirit owes<br/>
To His birth, and cross, and shame.<br/>
<br/>
When He came the angels sang<br/>
“Glory be to God on high,”<br/>
Lord, unloose my stammering tongue,<br/>
Who should louder sing than I.<br/>
<br/>
Did the Lord a man become<br/>
That He might the law fulfill,<br/>
Bleed and suffer in my room,<br/>
And canst thou, my tongue, be still?<br/>
<br/>
No, I must my praises bring,<br/>
Though they worthless are, and weak;<br/>
For should I refuse to sing<br/>
Sure the very stones would speak.<br/>
<br/>
O my Savior, Shield, and Sun,<br/>
Shepherd, Brother, Husband, Friend,<br/>
Every precious name in one;<br/>
I will love Thee without end.<br/>
