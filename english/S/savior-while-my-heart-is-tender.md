<center>
Savior, while my heart is tender,<br/>
I would yield that heart to Thee;<br/>
All my powers to Thee surrender,<br/>
Thine and only Thine to be.<br/>
<br/>
Take me now, Lord Jesus, take me;<br/>
Let my youthful heart be Thine;<br/>
Thy devoted servant make me;<br/>
Fill my soul with love divine.<br/>
<br/>
Send me, Lord, where Thou wilt send me,<br/>
Only do Thou guide my way;<br/>
May Thy grace through life attend me,<br/>
Gladly then shall I obey.<br/>
<br/>
Let me do Thy will or bear it;<br/>
I would know no will but Thine;<br/>
Shouldst Thou take my life or spare it,<br/>
I that life to Thee resign.<br/>
<br/>
May this solemn consecration<br/>
Never once forgotten be;<br/>
Let it know no revocation,<br/>
Registered and confirmed by Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thine I am, O Lord, for ever<br/>
To Thy service set apart;<br/>
Suffer me to leave Thee never,<br/>
Seal Thine image on my heart.
