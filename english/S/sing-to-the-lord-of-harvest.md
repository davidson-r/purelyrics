<br/>
Sing to the Lord of harvest,<br/>
Sing songs of love and praise;<br/>
With joyful hearts and voices<br/>
Your alleluias raise.<br/>
By Him the rolling seasons<br/>
In fruitful order move;<br/>
Sing to the Lord of harvest,<br/>
A joyous song of love.<br/>
<br/>
By Him the clouds drop fatness,<br/>
The deserts bloom and spring,<br/>
The hills leap up in gladness,<br/>
The valleys laugh and sing.<br/>
He filleth with His fullness<br/>
All things with large increase,<br/>
He crowns the year with goodness,<br/>
With plenty and with peace.<br/>
<br/>
Bring to His sacred altar<br/>
The gifts His goodness gave,<br/>
The golden sheaves of harvest,<br/>
The souls He died to save.<br/>
Your hearts lay down before Him<br/>
When at His feet you fall,<br/>
And with your lives adore Him,<br/>
Who gave His life for all.<br/>
<br/>
To God, the gracious Father,<br/>
Who made us “very good,”<br/>
To Christ, Who, when we wandered,<br/>
Restored us with His blood,<br/>
And to the Holy Spirit,<br/>
Who doth upon us pour<br/>
His blessèd dews and sunshine,<br/>
Be praise forevermore!<br/>
