<br/>
Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!<br/>
All praise to Him belongs:<br/>
Who kindly lengthens out our days<br/>
Demands our choicest songs.<br/>
<br/>
His providence hath brought us through<br/>
Another various year:<br/>
We all with vows and anthems new<br/>
Before our God appear.<br/>
<br/>
Father, Thy mercies past we own;<br/>
Thy still continued care;<br/>
To Thee presenting, through Thy Son,<br/>
Whate’er we have or own.<br/>
<br/>
Our lips and lives shall gladly show<br/>
The wonders of Thy love,<br/>
While on in Jesu’s steps we go<br/>
To see Thy face above.<br/>
<br/>
Our residue of days or hours<br/>
Thine, wholly Thine, shall be;<br/>
And all our consecrated powers<br/>
A sacrifice to be:<br/>
<br/>
Till Jesus in the clouds appear<br/>
To saints on earth forgiven,<br/>
And bring the grand Sabbatic year,<br/>
The jubilee of Heaven.<br/>

</center>
