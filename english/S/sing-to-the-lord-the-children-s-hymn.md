<center>
Sing to the Lord the children’s hymn,<br/>
His gentle love declare,<br/>
Who bends amid the seraphim<br/>
To hear the children’s prayer.<br/>
<br/>
He at a mother’s breast was fed,<br/>
Though God’s own Son was He;<br/>
He learnt the first small words He said<br/>
At a meek mother’s knee.<br/>
<br/>
He held us to His mighty breast,<br/>
The children of the earth;<br/>
He lifted up His hands and blessed<br/>
The babes of human birth.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! from the stars His face will turn<br/>
On us with glances mild;<br/>
The angels of His presence yearn<br/>
To bless the little child.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us, O Jesus Lord, for Thee,<br/>
That so by Thy dear grace<br/>
We, children of the font, may see<br/>
Our heavenly Father’s face.
