<br/>
Some day the silver cord will break,<br/>
And I no more as now shall sing;<br/>
But oh, the joy when I shall wake<br/>
Within the palace of the King!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And I shall see Him face to face,<br/>
And tell the story—Saved by grace;<br/>
And I shall see Him face to face,<br/>
And tell the story—Saved by grace.<br/>
<br/>
Some day my earthly house will fall.<br/>
I cannot tell how soon ’twill be;<br/>
But this I know—my All in All<br/>
Has now a place in Heav’n for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Some day, when fades the golden sun<br/>
Beneath the rosy tinted west,<br/>
My blessèd Lord will say, “Well done!”<br/>
And I shall enter into rest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Some day: till then I’ll watch and wait,<br/>
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,<br/>
That when my Savior opens the gate,<br/>
My soul to Him may take its flight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
