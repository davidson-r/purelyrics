<br/>
Songs of thankfulness and praise,<br/>
Jesus, Lord, to Thee we raise,<br/>
Manifested by the star<br/>
To the sages from afar;<br/>
Branch of royal David’s stem<br/>
In Thy birth at Bethlehem;<br/>
Anthems be to Thee addressed,<br/>
God in man made manifest.<br/>
<br/>
Manifest at Jordan’s stream,<br/>
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;<br/>
And at Cana, wedding guest,<br/>
In Thy Godhead manifest;<br/>
Manifest in power divine,<br/>
Changing water into wine;<br/>
Anthems be to Thee addressed,<br/>
God in man made manifest.<br/>
<br/>
Manifest in making whole<br/>
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;<br/>
Manifest in valiant fight,<br/>
Quelling all the devil’s might;<br/>
Manifest in gracious will,<br/>
Ever bringing good from ill;<br/>
Anthems be to Thee addressed,<br/>
God in man made manifest.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and moon shall darkened be,<br/>
Stars shall fall, the heavens shall flee,<br/>
Christ will then like lightning shine,<br/>
All will see His glorious sign:<br/>
All will then the trumpet hear;<br/>
All will see the Judge appear;<br/>
Thou by all wilt be confessed,<br/>
God in man made manifest.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord,<br/>
Mirrored in Thy holy Word;<br/>
May we imitate Thee now,<br/>
And be pure, as pure art Thou;<br/>
That we like to Thee may be<br/>
At Thy great Epiphany;<br/>
And may praise Thee, ever blest,<br/>
God in man made manifest.<br/>
