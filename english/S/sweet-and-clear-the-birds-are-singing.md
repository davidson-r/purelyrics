<br/>
Sweet and clear the birds are singing,<br/>
At Easter dawn.<br/>
Hark, O hear, the bells are ringing,<br/>
On Easter morn!<br/>
And the song that they sing,<br/>
That good news we hear them ring,<br/>
Is “Christ the Lord is risen, is risen.”<br/>
<br/>
Birds, your hearts give to your singing,<br/>
And feel no fear.<br/>
Bells, fill all the air with ringing,<br/>
Let all men hear!<br/>
For the whole world is glad,<br/>
And with beauty new is clad;<br/>
Now Christ the Lord is risen, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
Leaf and bud, as now, were growing<br/>
In Galilee;<br/>
Lilies Jesus loved were blowing<br/>
As fair to see;<br/>
When the first Easter morn<br/>
Woke the world to joy new born,<br/>
For Christ the Lord is risen, was risen.<br/>
<br/>
Easter buds will soon be flowers,<br/>
Fragrant and gay;<br/>
Winter’s snows give place to showers,<br/>
And night to day;<br/>
Hope and joy come again,<br/>
Life and light forever reign;<br/>
Yea! Christ the Lord is risen, is risen!<br/>
