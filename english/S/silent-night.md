<br/>
Silent night, holy night<br/>
All is calm, all is bright<br/>
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child<br/>
Holy Infant so tender and mild<br/>
Sleep in heavenly peace<br/>
Sleep in heavenly peace<br/>
<br/>
Silent night, holy night!<br/>
Shepherds quake at the sight<br/>
Glories stream from heaven afar<br/>
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!<br/>
Christ, the Saviour is born<br/>
Christ, the Saviour is born<br/>
<br/>
Silent night, holy night<br/>
Son of God, love's pure light<br/>
Radiant beams from Thy holy face<br/>
With the dawn of redeeming grace<br/>
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth<br/>
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth "<br/>
