<center>
The saints of God! their conflict past,<br/>
And life’s long battle won at last,<br/>
No more they need the shield or sword,<br/>
They cast them down before their Lord:<br/>
O happy saints! forever blest,<br/>
At Jesus feet’ how safe your rest!<br/>
<br/>
The saints of God! their wand’rings done,<br/>
No more their weary course they run,<br/>
No more they faint, no more they fall,<br/>
No foes oppress, no fears appall:<br/>
O happy saints! forever blest,<br/>
In that dear home how sweet your rest!<br/>
<br/>
The saints of God! life’s voyage o’er,<br/>
Safe landed on that blissful shore,<br/>
No stormy tempests now they dread,<br/>
No roaring billows lift their head:<br/>
O happy saints! forever blest,<br/>
In that calm haven of your rest!<br/>
<br/>
The saints of God their vigil keep,<br/>
While yet their mortal bodies sleep,<br/>
Till from the dust they too shall rise<br/>
And soar triumphant to the skies:<br/>
O happy saints! rejoice and sing:<br/>
He quickly comes, your Lord and King!<br/>
<br/>
O God of saints! to Thee we cry;<br/>
O Savior! plead for us on high;<br/>
O Holy Ghost! our Guide and Friend,<br/>
Grant us Thy grace till life shall end;<br/>
That with all the saints our rest may be<br/>
In that bright paradise with Thee!
