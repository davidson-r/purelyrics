<br/>
Silently the shades of evening<br/>
Gather round my lowly door;<br/>
Silently they bring before me<br/>
Faces I shall see no more.<br/>
<br/>
O the lost, the unforgotten,<br/>
Though the world be oft forgot!<br/>
O the shrouded and the lonely,<br/>
In our hearts they perish not!<br/>
<br/>
Living in the silent hours,<br/>
Where our spirits only blend,<br/>
They, unlinked with earthly trouble,<br/>
We, still hoping for its end.<br/>
<br/>
How such holy memories cluster,<br/>
Like the stars when storms are past,<br/>
Pointing up to that fair heaven,<br/>
We may hope to gain at last.<br/>
