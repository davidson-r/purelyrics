<br/>
Soon shall we see the glorious morning!<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
Sinners, attend the notes of warning!<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
The resurrection day draws near,<br/>
The King of saints shall soon appear,<br/>
And high His royal standard rear:<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
<br/>
Hear ye the trump of God resounding,<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
Through death’s dark vaults its notes rebounding:<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
To meet the Bridegroom haste! prepare!<br/>
Put on your bridal garments fair;<br/>
And hail your Savior in the air!<br/>
Saints, arise! Saints, arise!<br/>
<br/>
The saints who sleep, with joy awaken,<br/>
All arise! All arise!<br/>
Their clay cold beds are quick forsaken,<br/>
All arise! All arise!<br/>
Not one of all the faithful few<br/>
Who here on earth the Savior knew,<br/>
But starts with bliss his Lord to view:<br/>
All arise! All arise!<br/>
<br/>
Fast by the throne of God behold them<br/>
Crowned at last! Crowned at last!<br/>
See in His arms the Savior fold them,<br/>
Crowned at last! Crowned at last!<br/>
With wreaths of glory round their head;<br/>
No tears of sorrow now are shed,<br/>
To joy’s full fountain all are led:<br/>
Crowned at last! Crowned at last!<br/>
