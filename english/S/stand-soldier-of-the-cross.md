title: Stand Soldier Of The Cross

<center>
Stand, soldier of the cross,<br/>
Thy high allegiance claim,<br/>
And vow to hold the world but loss<br/>
For thy Redeemer’s Name.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, and be baptized,<br/>
And wash thy sins away;<br/>
Thy league with God be solemnized,<br/>
Thy faith avouched today.<br/>
<br/>
No more thine own, but Christ’s,<br/>
With all the saints of old,<br/>
Apostles, seers, evangelists,<br/>
And martyr throngs enrolled.<br/>
<br/>
In God’s whole armor strong,<br/>
Front hell’s embattled powers:<br/>
The warfare may be sharp and long,<br/>
The victory must be ours.<br/>
<br/>
O bright the conqueror’s crown,<br/>
The song of triumph sweet,<br/>
When faith casts every trophy down<br/>
At our great Captain’s feet.
