<center>
Spirit of mercy, truth and love,<br/>
O shed Thine influence from above,<br/>
And still from age to age convey<br/>
The wonders of this sacred day.<br/>
<br/>
In every clime, by every tongue,<br/>
Be God’s amazing glory sung;<br/>
Let all the listening earth be taught<br/>
The wonders by our Savior wrought.<br/>
<br/>
Unfailing Comfort, heavenly Guide,<br/>
Still o’er Thy holy Church preside;<br/>
Still let mankind Thy blessings prove,<br/>
Spirit of mercy, truth and love.
