title: Sky can still remember

<center>
The sky can still remember the earliest Christmas morn,<br/>
When in the cold December the Savior Christ was born.<br/>
No star unfolds its glory, no trumpet wind is blown,<br/>
But tells the Christmas story in music of its own.<br/>
<br/>
O never failing splendor! O never silent song!<br/>
Still keep the green earth tender, still keep the gray earth strong,<br/>
Still keep the brave earth dreaming of deeds that shall be done,<br/>
While children’s lives come streaming like sunbeams from the sun.<br/>
<br/>
O angels sweet and splendid, throng in our hearts and sing<br/>
The wonders which attended the coming of the King;<br/>
Till we too, boldly pressing where once the shepherds trod,<br/>
Climb Bethlehem’s Hill of Blessing, and find the Son of God.
