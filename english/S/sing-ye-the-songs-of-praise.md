Sing ye the songs of praise; Jesus is come!<br/>
High your glad voices raise; Jesus is come!<br/>
Cast worldly cares away, worship and homage pay;<br/>
Welcome the bless√®d day, Jesus is come!<br/>
<br/>
This day in Bethlehem, Jesus was born!<br/>
King of Jerusalem, Jesus was born!<br/>
Sun of all righteousness, shining and blessedness,<br/>
Healing our wretchedness, Jesus was born!<br/>
<br/>
Cleanse us from all our sin, Savior divine!<br/>
Make our thoughts pure within, Savior divine!<br/>
Lo! now the herald sound carols the love profound,<br/>
Telling of Jesus found, Savior divine!<br/>
<br/>
Save through Thy merit, great Prince of Peace!<br/>
Give Thy good Spirit, great Prince of Peace!<br/>
Let not Thy love depart, but holy gifts impart,<br/>
Born into every heart, great Prince of Peace!
