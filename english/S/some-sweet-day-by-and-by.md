title: Some Sweet Day By And By

<center>
<br/>
We shall reach the summer land,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
We shall press the golden strand,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
Oh, the loved ones watching there,<br/>
By the tree of life so fair,<br/>
Till we come their joy to share,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
By and by, Some sweet day,<br/>
We shall meet our loved ones gone,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by.<br/>
<br/>
At the crystal river’s brink,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
We shall find each broken link,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
Then the star that, fading here,<br/>
Left our hearts and homes so drear,<br/>
We shall see more bright and clear,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, these parting scenes will end,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
We shall gather friend with friend,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by;<br/>
There before our Father’s throne,<br/>
When the mists and clouds have flown,<br/>
We shall know as we are known,<br/>
Some sweet day, by and by.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
