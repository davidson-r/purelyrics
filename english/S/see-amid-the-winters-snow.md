See amid the winter's snow,<br/>
Born for us on earth below,<br/>
See the tender Lamb appears,<br/>
Promised from eternal years.<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
Hail, thou ever-blessed morn!<br/>
Hail, redemption's happy dawn!<br/>
Sing through all Jerusalem,<br/>
Christ is born in Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, within a manger lies<br/>
He who built the starry skies;<br/>
He who throned in height sublime<br/>
Sits amid the cherubim. Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Say, ye holy shepherds, say<br/>
What your joyful news today;<br/>
Wherefore have ye left your sheep<br/>
On the lonely mountain steep? Chorus<br/>
<br/>
"As we watched at dead of night,<br/>
Lo, we saw a wondrous light; [1]<br/>
Angels singing peace on earth<br/>
Told us of the Saviour's birth". Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Sacred infant, all divine,<br/>
What a tender love was thine,<br/>
Thus to come from highest bliss<br/>
Down to such a world as this. Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Teach, O teach us , Holy Child,<br/>
By Thy Face so meek and mild,<br/>
Teach us to resemble Thee,<br/>
In Thy Sweet humility! Chorus
