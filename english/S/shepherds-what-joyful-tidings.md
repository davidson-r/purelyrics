<br/>
Shepherds, what joyful tidings<br/>
Have made you sing and play?<br/>
Long have we been awaiting<br/>
The Lamb that came today.<br/>
Cherubim, seraphim sang to us merrily,<br/>
“Fear not, but hurry ye over to Bethlehem.”<br/>
<br/>
When they drew near the stable<br/>
They saw the newborn Child<br/>
Lain on straw in the manger<br/>
Like lamb on upland wild<br/>
Tearful His tiny lids wavered with shuddering,<br/>
Cold was the welcome they gave Him in Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetly He slept and slumbered,<br/>
In Mary’s arms so mild,<br/>
Shepherds humbly adored Him<br/>
And Mary then replied,<br/>
“Back to your fold, carry peace and tranquility,<br/>
My little Son gives you peace and love evermore.”<br/>
