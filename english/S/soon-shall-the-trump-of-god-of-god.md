title: Soon Shall The Trump Of God Of God

<center>
<br/>
Soon shall the trump of God<br/>
Give out the welcome sound,<br/>
That shakes death’s silent chamber walls,<br/>
And breaks the turf-sealed ground.<br/>
<br/>
You dwellers in the dust,<br/>
Awake, come forth, and sing;<br/>
Sharp has your frost of winter been,<br/>
But bright shall be your spring.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas sown in weakness here;<br/>
’Twill then be raised in power;<br/>
That which was sown an earthly seed<br/>
Shall rise a heav’nly flower.<br/>
