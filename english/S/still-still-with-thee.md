title: Still Still With Thee

<center>
Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,<br/>
When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;<br/>
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,<br/>
Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,<br/>
The solemn hush of nature newly born;<br/>
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,<br/>
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.<br/>
<br/>
As in the dawning o’er the waveless ocean<br/>
The image of the morning star doth rest,<br/>
So in the stillness Thou beholdest only<br/>
Thine image in the waters of my breast.<br/>
<br/>
Still, still with Thee, as to each newborn morning,<br/>
A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,<br/>
So does this blessèd consciousness, awaking,<br/>
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,<br/>
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer;<br/>
Sweet the repose beneath the wings o’ershading,<br/>
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there.<br/>
<br/>
So shall it be at last, in that bright morning,<br/>
When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;<br/>
O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,<br/>
Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee.
