<br/>
Soul of Jesus, make me whole,<br/>
Meek and contrite make my soul;<br/>
Thou most stainless Soul divine,<br/>
Cleanse this sordid soul of mine,<br/>
Hallow this my contrite heart,<br/>
Purify my every part;<br/>
Soul of Jesus, hallow me,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Save me, body of my Lord,<br/>
Save a sinner, vile, abhorred;<br/>
Sacred body, wan and worn,<br/>
Bruised and mangled, scourged and torn,<br/>
Piercèd hands and feet and side,<br/>
Rent, insulted, crucified:<br/>
Save me: to the cross I flee,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Blood of Jesus, stream of life,<br/>
Sacred stream with blessings rife,<br/>
From the broken body shed<br/>
On the cross, that altar dread;<br/>
Giv’n to be our drink divine,<br/>
Fill my heart and make it thine;<br/>
Blood of Christ, my succor be,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Holy water, stream that poured<br/>
From Thy riven side, O Lord,<br/>
Wash thou me without, within,<br/>
Cleanse me from the taint of sin,<br/>
Till my soul is clean and white,<br/>
Bathed and purified and bright<br/>
As a ransomed soul should be,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, by the wondrous power<br/>
Of Thine awful passion hour,<br/>
By the unimagined woe<br/>
Mortal man may never know;<br/>
By the curse upon Thee laid,<br/>
By the ransom Thou hast paid,<br/>
By Thy passion comfort me,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, by Thy bitter death,<br/>
By Thy last expiring breath,<br/>
Give me the eternal life,<br/>
Purchased by that mortal strife;<br/>
Thou didst suffer death that I<br/>
Might not die eternally;<br/>
By Thy dying quicken me,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
<br/>
Miserere, let me be<br/>
Never parted, Lord, from Thee;<br/>
Guard me from my ruthless foe,<br/>
Save me from eternal woe;<br/>
When the hour of death is near,<br/>
And my spirit faints for fear,<br/>
Call me with Thy voice of love,<br/>
Place me near to Thee above,<br/>
With Thine angel host to raise<br/>
An undying song of praise,<br/>
Miserere Domine.<br/>
