<br/>
Songs of praise the angels sang,<br/>
Heav’n with alleluias rang,<br/>
When creation was begun,<br/>
When God spoke and it was done.<br/>
<br/>
Songs of praise awoke the morn<br/>
When the Prince of Peace was born;<br/>
Songs of praise arose when He<br/>
Captive led Captivity.<br/>
<br/>
Heav’n and earth must pass away!<br/>
Songs of praise shall crown that day!<br/>
God will make new heav’ns and earth;<br/>
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.<br/>
<br/>
And can man alone be dumb,<br/>
Till that glorious kingdom come?<br/>
No: the church delights to raise<br/>
Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.<br/>
<br/>
Saints below, with heart and voice,<br/>
Still in songs of praise rejoice,<br/>
Learning here, by faith and love,<br/>
Songs of praise to sing above.<br/>
<br/>
Borne upon their latest breath,<br/>
Songs of praise shall conquer death;<br/>
Then amidst eternal joy,<br/>
Songs of praise their powers employ.<br/>
<br/>
Hymns of glory, songs of praise,<br/>
Father, unto Thee we raise;<br/>
Jesus, glory unto Thee,<br/>
With the Spirit, ever be.<br/>
