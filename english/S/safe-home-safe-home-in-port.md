<br/>
Safe home, safe home in port!<br/>
Rent cordage, shattered deck,<br/>
Torn sails, provisions short,<br/>
And only not a wreck;<br/>
But oh! the joy upon the shore<br/>
To tell our voyage perils o’er!<br/>
<br/>
The prize, the prize secure!<br/>
The athlete nearly fell;<br/>
Bare all he could endure,<br/>
And bare not always well;<br/>
But he may smile at troubles gone<br/>
Who sets the victor-garland on.<br/>
<br/>
No more the foe can harm;<br/>
No more of leaguered camp,<br/>
And cry of night alarm,<br/>
And need of ready lamp;<br/>
And yet how nearly he had failed<br/>
How nearly had that foe prevailed!<br/>
<br/>
The lamb is in the fold,<br/>
In perfect safety penned;<br/>
The lion once had hold,<br/>
And thought to make an end;<br/>
But One came by with wounded side,<br/>
And for the sheep the Shepherd died.<br/>
<br/>
The exile is at home!<br/>
O nights and days of tears,<br/>
O longings not to roam,<br/>
O sins and doubts and fears;<br/>
What matters now grief’s darkest day?<br/>
The King has wiped those tears away.<br/>
