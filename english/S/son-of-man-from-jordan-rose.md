<br/>
The Son of Man from Jordan rose,<br/>
And prayed to God above;<br/>
When lo, the opening heav’ns disclose<br/>
A swift descending Dove.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit, lighting on His brow,<br/>
Anoints the Holy One;<br/>
The Father’s voice declaring, “Thou<br/>
Art My belovèd Son.”<br/>
<br/>
So when, through His baptizing blessed<br/>
The Font new birth conveys,<br/>
Man kneels a son of God confessed,<br/>
Heav’n opens as he prays.<br/>
<br/>
Fair innocency, like the dove’s,<br/>
Invests him, purged from sin;<br/>
For God the brooding Spirit moves,<br/>
Directs and rules within.<br/>
<br/>
O Christ, Whose mercy cleansed our stain<br/>
With streams of grace divine,<br/>
Let us not soil the robes again<br/>
Made white in blood of Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Redeemer of a world undone,<br/>
We praise Thee and adore,<br/>
Jesu, with God the Father One,<br/>
And Spirit evermore.<br/>
