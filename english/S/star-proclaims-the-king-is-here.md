title: Star Proclaims the King is here

<br/>
The star proclaims the King is here;<br/>
But, Herod, why this senseless fear?<br/>
He takes no realms of earth away<br/>
Who gives the realms of heav’nly day.<br/>
<br/>
The wiser Magi see from far<br/>
And follow on His guiding star;<br/>
And led by light, to light they press<br/>
And by their gifts their God confess.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Jordan’s crystal flood<br/>
In meekness stands the Lamb of God<br/>
And, sinless, sanctifies the wave,<br/>
Mankind from sin to cleanse and save.<br/>
<br/>
At Cana first His power is shown;<br/>
His might the blushing waters own<br/>
And, changing as He speaks the word,<br/>
Flow wine, obedient to their Lord.<br/>
<br/>
All glory, Jesus, be to Thee<br/>
For this Thy glad epiphany;<br/>
Whom with the Father we adore<br/>
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br/>
