<br/>
When we cross the valley there need be no shadows,<br/>
When life’s day is ended and its sorrows o’er;<br/>
When the summons comes to meet the blessèd Savior,<br/>
When we rise to dwell with Him forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Shadows! no need of shadows<br/>
When at last we lay life’s burdens down;<br/>
Shadows! no need of shadows!<br/>
When at last we gain the victor’s crown.<br/>
<br/>
When our loved ones leave us there need be no shadows,<br/>
If their faith is fixed in Jesus as their Lord;<br/>
For they go to be with Him Who died to save them,<br/>
To be with the One Whom they have long adored.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When He comes to meet us there need be no shadows,<br/>
When He comes in all His glorious array;<br/>
When the trump of God shall sound and loved ones waken,<br/>
When He leads us onward with triumphant sway.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
