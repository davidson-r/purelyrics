title: Spirit of God that moved of Old

<br/>
Spirit of God, that moved of old<br/>
Upon the waters’ darkened face,<br/>
Come, when our faithless hearts are cold,<br/>
And stir them with an inward grace.<br/>
<br/>
Thou that art power and peace combined,<br/>
All highest strength, all purest love,<br/>
The rushing of the mighty wind,<br/>
The brooding of the gentle dove.<br/>
<br/>
Come, give us still Thy powerful aid,<br/>
And urge us on, and make us Thine;<br/>
Nor leave the hearts that once were made<br/>
Fit temples for Thy grace divine.<br/>
<br/>
Nor let us quench Thy sev’nfold light;<br/>
But still with softest breathings stir<br/>
Our wayward souls, and lead us right,<br/>
O Holy Ghost, the Comforter.<br/>
