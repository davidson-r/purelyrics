<br/>
Shepherds! Shake off your drowsy sleep,<br/>
Rise and leave your silly sheep;<br/>
Angels from Heav’n around loud singing,<br/>
Tidings of great joy are bringing,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Shepherds! The chorus come and swell!<br/>
Sing Nowell, O sing Nowell!<br/>
<br/>
Hark! Even now the bells ring ’round;<br/>
Listen to their merry sound!<br/>
Hark! How the birds new songs are making,<br/>
As if winter’s chains were breaking,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Cometh at length the age of peace,<br/>
Strife and sorrow now shall cease;<br/>
Prophets foretold the wondrous story<br/>
Of this Heaven-born Prince of glory,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Shepherds! Then up and quick away!<br/>
Seek the Babe ere break of day;<br/>
He is the hope of every nation,<br/>
All in Him shall find salvation,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
