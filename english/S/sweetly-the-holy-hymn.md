Sweetly the holy hymn<br/>
Breaks on the morning air;<br/>
Before the world with smoke is dim<br/>
We meet to offer prayer.<br/>
<br/>
While flowers are wet with dews,<br/>
Dew of our souls, descend:<br/>
Ere yet the sun the day renews,<br/>
O Lord, Thy Spirit send.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the battlefield,<br/>
Before the fight begins,<br/>
We seek, O Lord, Thy sheltering shield,<br/>
To guard us from our sins.<br/>
<br/>
Ere yet our vessel sails<br/>
Upon the stream of day<br/>
We plead, O Lord, for heavenly gales<br/>
To speed us on our way!<br/>
<br/>
On the lone mountain side,<br/>
Before the morning’s light,<br/>
The Man of sorrows wept and cried,<br/>
And rose refreshed with might.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hear us then, for we<br/>
Are very weak and frail,<br/>
We make the Savior’s Name our plea,<br/>
And surely must prevail.
