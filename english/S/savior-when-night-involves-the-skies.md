title: Savior When Night Involves The Skies

<center>
<br/>
Savior, when night involves the skies,<br/>
My soul, adoring, turns to Thee;<br/>
Thee, self abased in mortal guise,<br/>
And wrapped in shades of death for me.<br/>
<br/>
On Thee my waking raptures dwell,<br/>
When crimson gleams the east adorn,<br/>
Thee, Victor of the grave and hell,<br/>
Thee, Source of life’s eternal morn.<br/>
<br/>
When noon her throne in light arrays,<br/>
To Thee my soul triumphant springs;<br/>
Thee, throned in glory’s endless blaze,<br/>
Thee, Lord of lords and King of kings.<br/>
<br/>
O’er earth when shades of evening steal,<br/>
To death and Thee my thoughts I give;<br/>
To death, whose power I soon shall feel,<br/>
To Thee, with Whom I trust to live.<br/>
