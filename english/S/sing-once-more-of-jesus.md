<br/>
Oh, sing once more of Jesus,<br/>
Tune every heart and voice,<br/>
Proclaim His tender mercy,<br/>
And in His love rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing, sing, sing once more,<br/>
Once more sing of Jesus;<br/>
Praise His wondrous, matchless love;<br/>
Sing once more of Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sing once more of Jesus,<br/>
The joyful strain prolong,<br/>
While angels hover round us,<br/>
And martyrs join the song.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sing once more of Jesus,<br/>
And now in early youth,<br/>
Come let us walk together,<br/>
The path of life and truth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sing once more of Jesus,<br/>
Our best and truest Friend,<br/>
Whose hand from snares of evil<br/>
Will still our hearts defend.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sing once more of Jesus,<br/>
Who bends a listening ear,<br/>
From yonder world of glory,<br/>
The childrenâ€™s song to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
