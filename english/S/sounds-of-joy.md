<br/>
Sounds of joy have put to flight<br/>
All the sadness of the night:<br/>
Now a maid beyond compare<br/>
Hears her praises fill the air:<br/>
Virgo María. <br/>
<br/>
Who is she whom angels sing,<br/>
Making all creation ring?<br/>
She it is who wins our praise,<br/>
As on earth our voice we raise:<br/>
Virgo María. <br/>
<br/>
Queen of virgins, Maiden mild,<br/>
Hear me, take me for your child.<br/>
Ever my protector be;<br/>
Bring eternal life to me:<br/>
Virgo María. <br/>
<br/>
Mighty Godhead, Three in One,<br/>
While eternal ages run,<br/>
Look to Mary, full of grace,<br/>
And forgive the human race:<br/>
Virgo María.  <br/>
