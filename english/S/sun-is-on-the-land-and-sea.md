<br/>
The sun is on the land and sea,<br/>
The day begun;<br/>
Our morning hymn begins with Thee,<br/>
Blest Three in One;<br/>
Our praise shall rise continually<br/>
Till day is done.<br/>
<br/>
Thy love was ever in our view,<br/>
Like stars, by night;<br/>
Thy gifts are every morning new,<br/>
O God of light;<br/>
Thy mercy, like the heavensâ€™ blue,<br/>
Fills all our sight.<br/>
<br/>
We do not know what grief or care<br/>
The day may bring;<br/>
The heart shall find some gladness there,<br/>
That loves its King;<br/>
The life that serves Thee everywhere<br/>
Can always sing.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Father be,<br/>
With Christ the Son,<br/>
And, Holy Spirit, unto Thee,<br/>
Forever One;<br/>
All glory to the Trinity<br/>
While ages run!<br/>
