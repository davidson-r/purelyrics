<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
Thy father guards the sheep,<br/>
Thy mother shakes the dreamland tree,<br/>
And from it fall sweet dreams for thee;<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
The large stars are the sheep,<br/>
The little ones the lambs, I guess,<br/>
The gentle moon the shepherdess,<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
Our Savior loves His sheep,<br/>
He is the Lamb of God on high,<br/>
Who for our sakes came down to die,<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
Sleep, baby, sleep!<br/>
