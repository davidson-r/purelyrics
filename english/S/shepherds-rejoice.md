“Shepherds, rejoice! lift up your eyes,<br/>
And send your fears away;<br/>
News from the regions of the skies,<br/>
Salvation’s born today.<br/>
<br/>
“Jesus, the God Whom angels fear,<br/>
Comes down to dwell with you;<br/>
Today He makes His entrance here,<br/>
But not as monarchs do.<br/>
<br/>
“No gold nor purple swaddling bands.<br/>
Nor royal shining things;<br/>
A manger for His cradle stands,<br/>
And holds the King of kings.<br/>
<br/>
“Go, shepherds, where the Infant lies,<br/>
And see His humble throne<br/>
With tears of joy in all your eyes,<br/>
Go, shepherds, kiss the Son.”<br/>
<br/>
Thus Gabriel sang, and straight around<br/>
The heav’nly armies throng;<br/>
They tune their harps to lofty sound,<br/>
And thus conclude the song:<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God that reigns above!<br/>
Let peace surround the earth!<br/>
Mortals shall know their Maker’s love,<br/>
At their Redeemer’s birth.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord, and shall angels have their songs,<br/>
And men no tunes to raise?<br/>
O may we lose our useless tongues<br/>
When they forget to praise.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God that reigns above,<br/>
That pitied us forlorn;<br/>
We join to sing our Maker’s love,<br/>
For there’s a Savior born.<br/>
