<br/>
Sealed was the tomb, guarded by soldiers,<br/>
Brightly the moonlight shone around;<br/>
Roadway and hill gleamed in the brightness,<br/>
Flooded with light the garden’s bound.<br/>
Brighter the light seen ’neath the olives;<br/>
Forms bright as sunlight, ’mid the trees,<br/>
Soldiers were there, clad as for warfare;<br/>
Lo! they are gone, and who are these?<br/>
See yonder, hast’ning to the city,<br/>
The trembling soldiers in terror go!<br/>
Earthquake astounding, strange light surrounding,<br/>
Drive them away these things to show.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O wonderful light in the garden,<br/>
That fadeth not away!<br/>
The King Who was laid in the shadow<br/>
With vict’ry is crowned this glorious day.<br/>
<br/>
Darkly they plan; falsely as darkly,<br/>
Stories that He was borne away<br/>
Borne by His friends, poor weak disciples,<br/>
Stol’n when the moon was bright as day!<br/>
Soldiers of Rome ne’er slept on duty,<br/>
False was the tale for silver told;<br/>
Death could not hold that mighty Victor!<br/>
Lift up your heads, ye gates of gold!<br/>
The morn of glory hath awakened,<br/>
And death no longer holds boundless pow’r;<br/>
Empty the prison, Jesus has risen;<br/>
Time hath no richer, grander hour.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
