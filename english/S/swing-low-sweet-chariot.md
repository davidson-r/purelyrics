<br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Coming for to carry me home,<br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Coming for to carry me home.<br/>
<br/>
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?<br/>
Coming for to carry me home,<br/>
A band of angels coming after me,<br/>
Coming for to carry me home.<br/>
<br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Coming for to carry me home,<br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Coming for to carry me home.<br/>
