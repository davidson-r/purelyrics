Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Shout the glad tidings, exultingly sing,<br/>
Jerusalem triumphs, Messiah is King!<br/>
<br/>
Zion, the marvelous story be telling,<br/>
The Son of the Highest, how lowly His birth!<br/>
The brightest archangel in glory excelling,<br/>
He stoops to redeem thee, He reigns upon earth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell how He cometh; from nation to nation<br/>
The heart cheering news let the earth echo round;<br/>
How free to the faithful He offers salvation,<br/>
His people with joy everlasting are crowned.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Mortals, your homage be gratefully bringing,<br/>
And sweet let the gladsome hosannas arise;<br/>
Ye angels, the full alleluias be singing;<br/>
One chorus resound through the earth and the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Messiah is King!<br/>
