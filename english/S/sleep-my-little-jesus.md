<br/>
Sleep, my little Jesus,<br/>
On Thy bed of hay,<br/>
While the shepherds homeward<br/>
Journey on their way.<br/>
Mother is Thy shepherd<br/>
And will her vigil keep:<br/>
Did the voices wake Thee?<br/>
O sleep, my Jesus, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Softly sleep, sweetly sleep,<br/>
My Jesus, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Sleep, my little Jesus,<br/>
While Thou art my own!<br/>
Ox and ass Thy neighbors,<br/>
Shalt Thou have a throne?<br/>
Will they call me bless√®d?<br/>
Shall I stand and weep?<br/>
Be it far, Jehovah!<br/>
O sleep, my Jesus, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sleep, my little Jesus,<br/>
Wonder-baby mine!<br/>
Well the singing angels<br/>
Greet Thee as divine.<br/>
Through my heart, as heaven<br/>
Low the echoes sweep<br/>
Of glory to Jehovah!<br/>
O sleep, my Jesus, sleep!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
