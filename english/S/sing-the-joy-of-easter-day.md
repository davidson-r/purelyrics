Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing the joy of Easter Day,<br/>
The Easter triumph tell,<br/>
Jesus rose on Easter Day,<br/>
The Lord Who loves us well.<br/>
<br/>
Good Joseph had a garden;<br/>
Amid its trees so tall<br/>
The Lord Christ stood on Easter Day,<br/>
He lives to save us all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And as He rose at Easter<br/>
He is alive for aye,<br/>
The very same Lord Jesus Christ<br/>
Who hears us sing today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Go tell the Lord Christ’s message,<br/>
The Easter triumph sing,<br/>
’Till all His waiting children know<br/>
That Jesus is their King.<br/>
<br/>
