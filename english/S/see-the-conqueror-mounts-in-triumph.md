<br/>
See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph; see the King in royal state,<br/>
Riding on the clouds, His chariot, to His heavenly palace gate.<br/>
Hark! the choirs of angel voices joyful alleluias sing,<br/>
And the portals high are lifted to receive their heavenly King.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this that comes in glory, with the trump of jubilee?<br/>
Lord of battles, God of armies, He has gained the victory.<br/>
He Who on the cross did suffer, He Who from the grave arose,<br/>
He has vanquished sin and Satan, He by death has spoiled His foes.<br/>
<br/>
While He lifts His hands in blessing, He is parted from His friends<br/>
While their eager eyes behold Him, He upon the clouds ascends;<br/>
He Who walked with God and pleased Him, preaching truth and doom to come,<br/>
He, our Enoch, is translated to His everlasting home.<br/>
<br/>
Now our heavenly Aaron enters, with His blood, within the veil;<br/>
Joshua now is come to Canaan, and the kings before Him quail;<br/>
Now He plants the tribes of Israel in their promised resting place;<br/>
Now our great Elijah offers double portion of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
He has raised our human nature in the clouds to God’s right hand;<br/>
There we sit in heavenly places, there with Him in glory stand:<br/>
Jesus reigns, adored by angels; man with God is on the throne;<br/>
Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension we by faith behold our own.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Ghost, llluminator, shed Thy beams upon our eyes,<br/>
Help us to look up with Stephen, and to see beyond the skies,<br/>
Where the Son of Man in glory standing is at God’s right hand,<br/>
Beckoning on His martyr army, succoring His faithful band.<br/>
<br/>
See Him, Who is gone before us, heavenly mansions to prepare,<br/>
See Him, who is ever pleading for us with prevailing prayer,<br/>
See Him, Who with sound of trumpet, and with His angelic train,<br/>
Summoning the world to judgment, on the clouds will come again.<br/>
<br/>
Raise us up from earth to Heaven, give us wings of faith and love,<br/>
Gales of holy aspirations wafting us to realms above;<br/>
That, with hearts and minds uplifted, we with Christ our Lord may dwell,<br/>
Where He sits enthroned in glory in His heavenly citadel.<br/>
<br/>
So at last, when He appeareth, we from out our graves may spring,<br/>
With our youth renewed like eagles, flocking round our heavenly King.<br/>
Caught up on the clouds of Heaven, and may meet Him in the air,<br/>
Rise to realms where He is reigning, and may reign for ever there.<br/>
<br/>
Glory be to God the Father, glory be to God the Son,<br/>
Dying, risen, ascending for us, Who the heavenly realm has won;<br/>
Glory to the Holy Spirit, to one God in persons Three;<br/>
Glory both in earth and heaven, glory, endless glory, be.<br/>
