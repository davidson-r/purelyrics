<center>
See, Father, Thy belovèd Son,<br/>
Whom here we now present to Thee;<br/>
The all sufficient Sacrifice,<br/>
The sinner’s one and only plea.<br/>
<br/>
Through Him we pray for all we love,<br/>
For all by pain or sin oppressed;<br/>
For souls departed in Thy fear:<br/>
O grant them eternal rest.
