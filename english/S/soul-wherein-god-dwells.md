title: Soul wherein God dwells

<center>
<br/>
The soul wherein God dwells<br/>
What church could holier be?<br/>
Becomes a walking tent<br/>
Of heavenly majesty.<br/>
<br/>
Though Christ a thousand times<br/>
In Bethlehem be born,<br/>
If Heâ€™s not born in thee,<br/>
Thy soul is still forlorn.<br/>
<br/>
O would thy heart but be<br/>
A manger for His birth,<br/>
God would once more become<br/>
A Child upon this earth.<br/>
