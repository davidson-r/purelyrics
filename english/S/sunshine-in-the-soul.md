title: Sunshine In The Soul

<center>
There is sunshine in my soul today,<br/>
More glorious and bright<br/>
Than glows in any earthly sky,<br/>
For Jesus is my Light.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O there’s sunshine, blessèd sunshine,<br/>
When the peaceful, happy moments roll;<br/>
When Jesus shows His smiling face,<br/>
There is sunshine in the soul.<br/>
<br/>
There is music in my soul today,<br/>
A carol to my King,<br/>
And Jesus, listening, can hear<br/>
The songs I cannot sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There is springtime in my soul today,<br/>
For, when the Lord is near,<br/>
The dove of peace sings in my heart,<br/>
The flowers of grace appear.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There is gladness in my soul today,<br/>
And hope and praise and love,<br/>
For blessings which He gives me now,<br/>
For joys “laid up” above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
