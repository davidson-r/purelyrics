<br/>
Thou Whose hand did lead Thy chosen people<br/>
Through the desert on their pilgrim way,<br/>
In Thy mercy grant us now Thy blessing,<br/>
Jesus help us all to watch and pray.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Father, Thou art pure and holy, holy,<br/>
May our hearts Thy temple be,<br/>
O, make us humble, meek and lowly,<br/>
Poor in spirit, Savior, more like Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Give us water from the sacred fountain,<br/>
While we journey in a thirsty land;<br/>
Strong in Thee no earthly foe can harm us,<br/>
Thou our Rock on which we firmly stand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gentle Savior, Thou wilt never leave us,<br/>
Still from danger and from storm defend,<br/>
Sweet the promise to Thy faithful children,<br/>
Thou wilt guide and keep them to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though we pass the dark and rolling river,<br/>
Thou wilt bear us safely to the shore;<br/>
We shall praise Thee in the vales of Eden,<br/>
With the saints and angels evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
