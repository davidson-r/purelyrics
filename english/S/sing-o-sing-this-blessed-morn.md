<br/>
Sing, O sing, this blessèd morn,<br/>
Unto us a Child is born,<br/>
Unto us a Son is given,<br/>
God Himself comes down from Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing, O sing, this blessèd morn,<br/>
Jesus Christ today is born.<br/>
<br/>
God of God, and Light of Light,<br/>
Come with mercies infinite,<br/>
Joining in a wondrous plan<br/>
Heaven to earth and God to man.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God with us, Emmanuel,<br/>
Deigns forever more to dwell;<br/>
He on Adam’s fallen race<br/>
Sheds the fullness of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God comes down that man may rise,<br/>
Lifted by Him to the skies;<br/>
Christ is Son of Man that we<br/>
Sons of God in Him may be.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O renew us, Lord, we pray,<br/>
With Thy Spirit day by day,<br/>
That we ever one may be<br/>
With the Father and with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
