<br/>
Sweet is the breath of morning air;<br/>
Sweet is the dawn, when skies are fair;<br/>
Sweeter by far than aught beside<br/>
In God’s own favor to abide.<br/>
<br/>
Blest be the gracious power above<br/>
For all our rest, and all His love;<br/>
For health preserved, for strength retained,<br/>
For faith renewed, and hope regained.<br/>
<br/>
Wake, and the song of joy up-raise;<br/>
Wake, and resound Jehovah’s praise;<br/>
Praise ye the God of death and night;<br/>
Praise ye the Lord of life and light!<br/>
<br/>
O, let Thy watchful care, dear Lord,<br/>
Direct each deed, and mold each word;<br/>
Check every thought that turns astray;<br/>
And guide and guard us through the day.<br/>
