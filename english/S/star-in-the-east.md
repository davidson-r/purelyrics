<br/>
Lo! the star in the East! over Bethlehem’s plain,<br/>
It shines as a guide to the place<br/>
Where the weary, worn trav’ler his hopes may attain,<br/>
And worship that Infant of Days.<br/>
While forth from their treasures, frankincense and gold,<br/>
And the costliest spices they bring.<br/>
For in their distant land it had long been foretold,<br/>
The birth of that glorious King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Let the glad world rejoice! Let the angelic bands<br/>
Their anthems triumphantly sing!<br/>
To God be the glory! Sound forth, all ye lands,<br/>
The coming of Jesus our King.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the star in the East! we may gaze on it now;<br/>
Be pilgrims, with it for our guide;<br/>
The lesson of Bethlehem, still ever new,<br/>
The manger, and cross where He died.<br/>
We may read, we may learn, from His birth to His grave,<br/>
The teachings of peace and of love;<br/>
For this is the King Who is mighty to save;<br/>
His grace and His love we may prove.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the star in the East! let us follow it still,<br/>
No pilgrim it e’er led astray;<br/>
Let us bow at His feet, let us study His will,<br/>
And ever His precepts obey.<br/>
What treasures have we to present to our King,<br/>
As an offering fitting and true?<br/>
Our hearts and ourselves, blessèd Jesus, we bring,<br/>
Accept us, and form us anew.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the star in the East! yet with far wider rays,<br/>
Shall its glorious shining go forth;<br/>
And earnestly plead, God would hasten the day,<br/>
When His knowledge shall fill all the earth.<br/>
We would lift up our prayers, we would strengthen our hands,<br/>
Would send out our means all abroad,<br/>
Till the glorious Gospel is heard in all lands,<br/>
And the world is converted to God.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
