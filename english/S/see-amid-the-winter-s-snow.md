<br/>
See amid the winter’s snow,<br/>
Born for us on earth below,<br/>
See, the gentle Lamb appears,<br/>
Promised from eternal years.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hail that ever blessèd morn,<br/>
Hail redemption’s happy dawn,<br/>
Sing through all Jerusalem:<br/>
Christ is born in Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, within a manger lies<br/>
He Who built the starry skies;<br/>
He Who, thronèd in height sublime,<br/>
Sits amid the cherubim.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Say, you holy shepherds, say,<br/>
Tell your joyful news today.<br/>
Why have you now left your sheep<br/>
On the lonely mountain steep?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“As we watched at dead of night,<br/>
Lo, we saw a wondrous light;<br/>
Angels singing ‘Peace on earth’<br/>
Told us of the Savior’s birth.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sacred Infant, all divine,<br/>
What a tender love was Thine,<br/>
Thus to come from highest bliss<br/>
Down to such a world as this.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Teach, O teach us, holy Child,<br/>
By Thy face so meek and mild,<br/>
Teach us to resemble Thee,<br/>
In Thy sweet humility.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
