Searcher of hearts, from mine erase<br/>
All thoughts that should not be,<br/>
And in its deep recesses trace<br/>
My gratitude to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Hearer of prayer, O guide aright<br/>
Each word and deed of mine;<br/>
Life’s battle teach me how to fight,<br/>
And be the vict’ry Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Giver of allfor ev’ry good<br/>
In the Redeemer came<br/>
For raiment, shelter, and for food,<br/>
I thank Thee in His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
Thou glorious Three in One,<br/>
Thou knowest best what I need most,<br/>
And let Thy will be done.
</center>
