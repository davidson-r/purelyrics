Sleep! Holy Babe! upon Thy mother’s breast;<br/>
Great Lord of earth and sea and sky,<br/>
How sweet it is to see Thee lie<br/>
In such a place of rest,<br/>
In such a place of rest.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep! Holy Babe! Thine angels watch around,<br/>
All bending low with folded wings,<br/>
Before th’incarnate King of kings,<br/>
In reverent awe profound.<br/>
In reverent awe profound.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep! Holy Babe! while I with Mary gaze<br/>
In joy upon that face awhile,<br/>
Upon the loving infant smile<br/>
Which there divinely plays.<br/>
Which there divinely plays.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep! Holy Babe! ah! take Thy brief repose;<br/>
Too quickly will Thy slumbers break,<br/>
And Thou to lengthened pains awake<br/>
That death alone shall close,<br/>
That death alone shall close.
