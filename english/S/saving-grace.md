<center>
O golden day, when light shall break,<br/>
And dawn’s bright glories shall unfold,<br/>
When He Who knows the path I take<br/>
Shall ope for me the gates of gold!<br/>
Earth’s little while will soon be past,<br/>
My pilgrim song will soon be over,<br/>
The grace that saves shall time outlast,<br/>
And be my theme on yonder shore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then I shall know as I am known,<br/>
And stand complete before the throne;<br/>
Then I shall see my Savior’s face,<br/>
And all my song shall be saving grace.<br/>
<br/>
Life’s upward way, a narrow path,<br/>
Leads on to that fair dwelling place,<br/>
Where, safe from sin, and storm, and wrath,<br/>
They live who trust redeeming grace.<br/>
Sing, sing, my heart, along the way,<br/>
The grace that saves will keep and guide<br/>
Till breaks the glorious crowning day,<br/>
And I shall cross to yonder side.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I dimly see my journey’s end,<br/>
But well I know Who guideth me.<br/>
I follow Him, that wondrous Friend,<br/>
Whose matchless love is full and free.<br/>
And when with Him I enter in,<br/>
And all the way look back to trace,<br/>
The conqueror’s palm I then shall win,<br/>
Through Christ and His redeeming grace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
