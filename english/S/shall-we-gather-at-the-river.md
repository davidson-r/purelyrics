<br/>
Shall we gather at the river,<br/>
Where bright angel feet have trod,<br/>
With its crystal tide forever<br/>
Flowing by the throne of God?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we’ll gather at the river,<br/>
The beautiful, the beautiful river;<br/>
Gather with the saints at the river<br/>
That flows by the throne of God.<br/>
<br/>
On the margin of the river,<br/>
Washing up its silver spray,<br/>
We will talk and worship ever,<br/>
All the happy golden day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Ere we reach the shining river,<br/>
Lay we every burden down;<br/>
Grace our spirits will deliver,<br/>
And provide a robe and crown.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
At the smiling of the river,<br/>
Mirror of the Savior’s face,<br/>
Saints, whom death will never sever,<br/>
Lift their songs of saving grace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Soon we’ll reach the silver river,<br/>
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;<br/>
Soon our happy hearts will quiver<br/>
With the melody of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
