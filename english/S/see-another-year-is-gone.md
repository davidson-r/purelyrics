title: See Another Year Is Gone

<center>
See! another year is gone!<br/>
Quickly have the seasons passed!<br/>
This we enter now upon<br/>
May to many prove our last.<br/>
Mercy hitherto has spared,<br/>
But have mercies been improved?<br/>
Let us ask, am I prepared<br/>
Should I be this year removed?<br/>
<br/>
Some we now no longer see,<br/>
Who their mortal race have run;<br/>
Seemed as fair for life as we,<br/>
When the former year begun;<br/>
Some, but who God only knows,<br/>
Who are here assembled now,<br/>
Ere the present year shall close,<br/>
To the stroke of death must bow.<br/>
<br/>
Life a field of battle is,<br/>
Thousands fall within our view;<br/>
And the next death-bolt that flies,<br/>
May be sent to me or you:<br/>
While we preach, and while we hear,<br/>
Help us, Lord, each one, to think,<br/>
Vast eternity is near,<br/>
I am standing on the brink.<br/>
<br/>
If from guilt and sin set free,<br/>
By the knowledge of Thy grace;<br/>
Welcome, then, the call will be<br/>
To depart and see Thy face:<br/>
To Thy saints, while here below,<br/>
With new years, new mercies come;<br/>
But the happiest year they know<br/>
Is their last, which leads them home.
