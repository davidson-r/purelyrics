title: Story of the Wise Men

<br/>
Long ago the glorious Christmas star<br/>
Guided wise men from afar,<br/>
To the little town of Bethlehem,<br/>
To the Savior of all men.<br/>
<br/>
Over hill, across the desert sand,<br/>
Slowly tâ€™ward the Holy Land,<br/>
With them precious loving gifts they bring,<br/>
Asking for the newborn King.<br/>
<br/>
When they saw the Child they all rejoiced,<br/>
Worshipped Him with tender voice,<br/>
Bowing low, presented gifts of love<br/>
To the Christ-child from above.<br/>
