<br/>
Servant of God, well done!<br/>
Thy glorious warfare’s past;<br/>
The battle’s fought, the race is won,<br/>
And thou art crowned at last.<br/>
<br/>
Of all thy heart’s desire<br/>
Triumphantly possessed;<br/>
Lodged by the ministerial choir<br/>
In thy Redeemer’s breast.<br/>
<br/>
In condescending love,<br/>
Thy ceaseless prayer He heard;<br/>
And bade thee suddenly remove<br/>
To thy complete reward.<br/>
<br/>
Ready to bring the peace,<br/>
Thy beauteous feet were shod,<br/>
When mercy signed thy soul’s release,<br/>
And caught thee up to God.<br/>
<br/>
With saints enthroned on high,<br/>
Thou dost thy Lord proclaim,<br/>
And still to God salvation cry,<br/>
Salvation to the Lamb!<br/>
<br/>
O happy, happy soul!<br/>
In ecstasies of praise,<br/>
Long as eternal ages roll,<br/>
Thou seest Thy Savior’s face.<br/>
<br/>
Redeemed from earth and pain,<br/>
Ah! when shall we ascend,<br/>
And all in Jesus’ presence reign<br/>
With our translated friend?<br/>
<br/>
Come, Lord, and quickly come!<br/>
And, when in Thee complete,<br/>
Receive Thy longing servants home,<br/>
To triumph at Thy feet.<br/>
