title: Savior Who Thy Flock Art Feeding

<center>
<br/>
Savior, Who Thy flock art feeding<br/>
With the Shepherd’s kindest care,<br/>
All the feeble gently leading,<br/>
While the lambs Thy bosom share.<br/>
<br/>
Now, these little ones receiving,<br/>
Fold them in Thy gracious arm;<br/>
There, we know, Thy Word believing,<br/>
Only there secure from harm.<br/>
<br/>
Never, from Thy pasture roving,<br/>
Let them be the lion’s prey;<br/>
Let Thy tenderness, so loving,<br/>
Keep them through life’s dangerous way.<br/>
<br/>
Then within Thy fold eternal<br/>
Let them find a resting place,<br/>
Feed in pastures ever vernal,<br/>
Drink the rivers of Thy grace.<br/>

</center>
