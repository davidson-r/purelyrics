<br/>
Savior of the nations, come;<br/>
Virgin’s Son, here make Thy home!<br/>
Marvel now, O heaven and earth,<br/>
That the Lord chose such a birth.<br/>
<br/>
Not by human flesh and blood;<br/>
By the Spirit of our God<br/>
Was the Word of God made flesh,<br/>
Woman’s offspring, pure and fresh.<br/>
<br/>
Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child<br/>
Of the virgin undefiled!<br/>
Though by all the world disowned,<br/>
Still to be in heaven enthroned.<br/>
<br/>
From the Father forth He came<br/>
And returneth to the same,<br/>
Captive leading death and hell<br/>
High the song of triumph swell!<br/>
<br/>
Thou, the Father’s only Son,<br/>
Hast over sin the victory won.<br/>
Boundless shall Thy kingdom be;<br/>
When shall we its glories see?<br/>
<br/>
Brightly doth Thy manger shine,<br/>
Glorious is its light divine.<br/>
Let not sin o’ercloud this light;<br/>
Ever be our faith thus bright.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to God the Father sing,<br/>
Praise to God the Son, our King,<br/>
Praise to God the Spirit be<br/>
Ever and eternally.<br/>
