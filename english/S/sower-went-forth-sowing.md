title: Sower Went Forth Sowing

<center>
The sower went forth sowing,<br/>
The seed in secret slept<br/>
Through weeks of faith and patience,<br/>
Till out the green blade crept;<br/>
And warmed by golden sunshine,<br/>
And fed by silver rain,<br/>
At last the fields were whitened<br/>
To harvest once again.<br/>
O praise the heavenly Sower,<br/>
Who gave the fruitful seed,<br/>
And watched and watered duly,<br/>
And ripened for our need.<br/>
<br/>
Behold! the heavenly Sower<br/>
Goes forth with better seed,<br/>
The Word of sure salvation,<br/>
With feet and hands that bleed;<br/>
Here in His Church ’tis scattered,<br/>
Our spirits are the soil;<br/>
Then let an ample fruitage<br/>
Repay His pain and toil.<br/>
Oh, beauteous is the harvest,<br/>
Wherein all goodness thrives,<br/>
And this the true thanksgiving,<br/>
The first fruits of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Within a hallowed acre<br/>
He sows yet other grain,<br/>
When peaceful earth receiveth<br/>
The dead He died to gain;<br/>
For though the growth be hidden,<br/>
We know that they shall rise;<br/>
Yea even now they ripen<br/>
In sunny Paradise.<br/>
O summer land of harvest,<br/>
O fields forever white<br/>
With souls that wear Christ’s raiment,<br/>
With crowns of golden light.<br/>
<br/>
One day the heavenly Sower<br/>
Shall reap where He hath sown,<br/>
And come again rejoicing,<br/>
And with Him bring His own;<br/>
And then the fan of judgment<br/>
Shall winnow from His floor<br/>
The chaff into the furnace<br/>
That flameth evermore.<br/>
O holy, awful Reaper,<br/>
Have mercy in the day,<br/>
Thou puttest in the sickle,<br/>
And cast us not away.
