Sweet Savior! in Thy pitying grace<br/>
Thy sweetness to our souls impart;<br/>
Thou only Lover of our race<br/>
Give healing to the wounded heart;<br/>
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry,<br/>
And save us, Jesu! lest we die.<br/>
<br/>
Long-suffering Jesu! hear our prayer<br/>
Who weep before Thee in our shame;<br/>
We have no hope but Thee; O spare,<br/>
Lord, spare us from th’undying flame;<br/>
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry,<br/>
And save us, Jesu! lest we die.<br/>
<br/>
All we have broken Thy command;<br/>
Lord, help us for Thy mercies’ sake;<br/>
Deliver us from Satan’s hand,<br/>
And safely to Thy kingdom take;<br/>
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry,<br/>
And save us, Jesu! lest we die.<br/>
<br/>
We flee for refuge to Thy love,<br/>
Salvation of the helpless soul;<br/>
Pour down Thy radiance from above,<br/>
And make these sin-worn spirits whole:<br/>
Oh! hear Thy contrite servants’ cry,<br/>
And save us, Jesu! lest we die.
