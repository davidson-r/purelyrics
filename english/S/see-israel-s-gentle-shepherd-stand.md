See Israel’s gentle Shepherd stand<br/>
With all engaging charms;<br/>
Hark! how He calls the tender lambs,<br/>
And folds them in His arms.<br/>
<br/>
“Permit them to approach,” He cries,<br/>
“Nor scorn their humble name;<br/>
For ’twas to bless such souls as these<br/>
The Lord of angels came.”<br/>
<br/>
We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,<br/>
And yield them up to Thee;<br/>
Joyful that we ourselves are Thine,<br/>
Thine let our offspring be.<br/>
<br/>
Ye little flock, with pleasure hear;<br/>
Ye children, seek His face,<br/>
And fly with transport to receive<br/>
The blessings of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
If orphans they are left behind,<br/>
Thy guardian care we trust,<br/>
That care shall heal our bleeding hearts,<br/>
While weeping o’er their dust.
