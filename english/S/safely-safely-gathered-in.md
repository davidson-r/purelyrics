title: Safely Safely Gathered In

<center>
Safely, safely, gathered in,<br/>
Far from sorrow, far from sin,<br/>
No more childish griefs or fears,<br/>
No more sadness, no more tears;<br/>
For the life so young and fair<br/>
Now hath passed from earthly care;<br/>
God Himself the soul will keep,<br/>
Giving His belovèd—sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Safely, safely, gathered in,<br/>
Far from sorrow, far from sin,<br/>
Passed beyond all grief and pain,<br/>
Death for thee is truest gain;<br/>
For our loss we must not weep,<br/>
Nor our loved ones long to keep<br/>
From the home of rest and peace,<br/>
Where all sin and sorrow cease.<br/>
<br/>
Safely, safely, gathered in,<br/>
Far from sorrow, far from sin,<br/>
God has saved from weary strife,<br/>
In its dawn, this fresh young life;<br/>
Now it waits for us above,<br/>
Resting in the Savior’s love;<br/>
Jesu, grant that we may meet<br/>
There, adoring, at Thy feet.
