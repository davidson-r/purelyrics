<br/>
Shall man, O God of light and life,<br/>
Forever molder in the grave?<br/>
Canst Thou forget Thy glorious work,<br/>
Thy promise, and Thy power to save?<br/>
<br/>
In those dark, silent realms of night,<br/>
Shall peace and hope no more arise?<br/>
No future morning light the tomb,<br/>
Nor daystar gild the darksome skies?<br/>
<br/>
Cease, cease, ye vain, desponding fears:<br/>
When Christ, our Lord, from darkness sprang,<br/>
Death, the last foe, was captive led,<br/>
And Heaven with praise and wonder rang.<br/>
<br/>
Faith sees the bright, eternal doors<br/>
Unfold, to make His children way;<br/>
They shall be clothed with endless life,<br/>
And shine in everlasting day.<br/>
