<br/>
Unto the hills around do I lift up my longing eyes<br/>
O whence for me shall my salvation come, from whence arise?<br/>
From God, the Lord, doth come my certain aid,<br/>
From God, the Lord, who heaven and earth hath made.<br/>
<br/>
He will not suffer that thy foot be moved: safe shalt thou be.<br/>
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close, who keepeth thee.<br/>
Behold, He sleepeth not, He slumbereth neâ€™er,<br/>
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.<br/>
<br/>
Jehovah is Himself thy Keeper true, thy changeless Shade;<br/>
Jehovah thy Defense on thy right hand Himself hath made.<br/>
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;<br/>
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.<br/>
<br/>
From every evil shall He keep thy soul, from every sin;<br/>
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out, thy coming in.<br/>
Above thee watching, He Whom we adore<br/>
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, forevermore.<br/>
