<br/>
Upon the Gospel’s sacred page<br/>
The gathered beams of ages shine;<br/>
And, as it hastens, every age<br/>
But makes its brightness more divine.<br/>
<br/>
On mightier wing, in loftier flight,<br/>
From year to year does knowledge soar;<br/>
And, as it soars, the Gospel light<br/>
Becomes effulgent more and more.<br/>
<br/>
More glorious still, as centuries roll,<br/>
New regions blest, new powers unfurled,<br/>
Expanding with the expanding soul,<br/>
Its radiance shall o’er flow the world.<br/>
<br/>
Flow to restore, but not destroy,<br/>
As when the cloudless lamp of day<br/>
Pours out its floods of light and joy,<br/>
And sweeps the lingering mists away.<br/>
