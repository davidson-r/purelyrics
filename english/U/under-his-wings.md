<br/>
Under His wings I am safely abiding,<br/>
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,<br/>
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me,<br/>
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Under His wings, under His wings,<br/>
Who from His love can sever?<br/>
Under His wings my soul shall abide,<br/>
Safely abide forever.<br/>
<br/>
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!<br/>
How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!<br/>
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,<br/>
There I find comfort, and there I am blessed.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Under His wings, oh, what precious enjoyment!<br/>
There will I hide till life’s trials are o’er;<br/>
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me,<br/>
Resting in Jesus, I’m safe evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
