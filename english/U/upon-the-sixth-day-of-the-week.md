Upon the sixth day of the week<br/>
The first man had his birth,<br/>
In God’s own image bright and pure<br/>
Created from the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the sixth day of the week<br/>
The second Adam died,<br/>
And by the second Adam’s death<br/>
Man was revivified.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the seventh day of the week<br/>
God from His works did rest,<br/>
And on that holy Sabbath day<br/>
The works of God were blessed.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the seventh day of the week<br/>
Christ in the grave did rest,<br/>
The grave is now a holy place;<br/>
A Sabbath for the blest.<br/>
<br/>
By tasting the forbidden tree<br/>
Man fell in Paradise;<br/>
Upon the tree Christ tasted death,<br/>
And by His death we rise.<br/>
<br/>
Christ in a garden buried lay,<br/>
Which spring-flowers did adorn;<br/>
And there our Resurrection bloomed<br/>
On the bright Easter morn.<br/>
<br/>
The grave itself a garden is,<br/>
Where loveliest flowers abound,<br/>
For Christ our amaranthine Life<br/>
Sprang from the holy ground.<br/>
<br/>
He by the Spirit once was born<br/>
Pure from the virgin’s womb,<br/>
And by the Spirit once again,<br/>
Born from the virgin tomb.<br/>
<br/>
Oh give us grace to die to sin,<br/>
That we, O Lord, may have<br/>
A holy, happy rest with Thee,<br/>
A Sabbath in the grave.<br/>
<br/>
O may we buried be with Thee,<br/>
And with Thee, Lord, arise<br/>
To an eternal Easter-day<br/>
Of glory in the skies!
