<br/>
Upward where the stars are burning,<br/>
Silent, silent in their turning<br/>
Round the never changing pole;<br/>
Upward where the sky is brightest,<br/>
Upward where the blue is lightest,<br/>
Lift I now my longing soul.<br/>
<br/>
Far above that arch of gladness,<br/>
Far beyond these clouds of sadness,<br/>
Are the many mansions fair.<br/>
Far from pain and sin and folly,<br/>
In that palace of the holy,<br/>
I would find my mansion there.<br/>
<br/>
Where the glory brightly dwelleth,<br/>
Where the new song sweetly swelleth,<br/>
And the discord never comes;<br/>
Where life’s stream is ever laving,<br/>
And the palm is ever waving,<br/>
That must be the home of homes.<br/>
<br/>
Where the Lamb on high is seated,<br/>
By ten thousand voices greeted,<br/>
Lord of lords, and King of kings.<br/>
Son of Man, they crown, they crown Him,<br/>
Son of God, they own, they own Him;<br/>
With His Name the palace rings.<br/>
<br/>
Blessing, honor, without measure,<br/>
Heavenly riches, earthly treasure,<br/>
Lay we at His blessèd feet:<br/>
Poor the praise that now we render,<br/>
Loud shall be our voices yonder,<br/>
When before His throne we meet.<br/>
