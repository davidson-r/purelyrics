title: Up and away

<center>
Up, and away, while the blush of the morning<br/>
Tips every leaf with its pure, bright ray;<br/>
Up, while the springtime the earth is adorning,<br/>
Come, while the Savior is calling today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Give to the Savior each grateful emotion;<br/>
Give Him, with gladness, our earnest devotion;<br/>
Then will His love, rolling on like the ocean,<br/>
Fill every heart with its fullness today.<br/>
<br/>
Up, and away, on the journey before us;<br/>
Follow the Savior in youth’s bright spring;<br/>
Now while the cloud of His mercy is o’er us,<br/>
Haste, let us go, and rejoice while we sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Up, and away, for the moments are fleeting;<br/>
Up, and away, like the tried and true;<br/>
Up, and away, to each other repeating,<br/>
“God has a work for the children to do.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Up, and away, to the fair land of glory;<br/>
There may we rest, when our journey’s past;<br/>
Rest with the faithful, proclaiming the story,<br/>
“Through our Redeemer we’re safe, safe at last.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
