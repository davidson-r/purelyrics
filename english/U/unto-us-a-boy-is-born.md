Unto us a boy is born,<br/>
King of all creation:<br/>
Cradled in a stall was He,<br/>
The Lord of every nation,<br/>
The Lord of every nation.<br/>
<br/>
Cradled in a stall was he<br/>
With sleepy cows and asses;<br/>
But the very beasts could see<br/>
That He all men surpasses.<br/>
<br/>
Herod then with fear was filled:<br/>
'A prince', he said, 'In Jewry!'<br/>
All little boys be killed<br/>
At Bethl'em in his fury.<br/>
<br/>
Now may Mary's Son, who came<br/>
So long ago to love us,<br/>
Lead us all with hearts aflame<br/>
Unto the joys above us.<br/>
<br/>
Omega and Alpha He!<br/>
Let the organ thunder,<br/>
While the choir with peals of glee<br/>
Doth rend the air asunder.
