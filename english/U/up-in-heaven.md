<center>
Up in Heaven, up in Heaven,<br/>
In the bright place far away,<br/>
He Whom bad men crucified,<br/>
Sitteth at His Father’s side,<br/>
Til the Judgment Day.<br/>
<br/>
And He loves His little children,<br/>
And He pleadeth for them there,<br/>
Asking the great God of Heav’n<br/>
That their sins may be forgiven,<br/>
And He hears their prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Never more a helpless Baby,<br/>
Born in poverty and pain,<br/>
But with awful glory crowned,<br/>
With His angels standing round,<br/>
He shall come again.<br/>
<br/>
Then the wicked souls shall tremble,<br/>
And the good souls shall rejoice;<br/>
Parents, children, every one,<br/>
Then shall stand before His throne,<br/>
And shall hear His voice.<br/>
<br/>
And all faithful holy Christians,<br/>
Who their Master’s work have done,<br/>
Shall appear at His right hand<br/>
And inherit the fair land<br/>
That His love has won.
