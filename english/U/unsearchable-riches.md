<br/>
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ,<br/>
Wealth that can never be told!<br/>
Riches exhaustless of mercy and grace,<br/>
Precious, more precious than gold!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Precious, more precious,<br/>
Wealth that can never be told!<br/>
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!<br/>
Precious, more precious than gold.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!<br/>
Who shall their greatness declare?<br/>
Jewels whose luster our lives may adorn,<br/>
Pearls that the poorest may wear!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!<br/>
Freely, how freely they flow,<br/>
Making the souls of the faithful and true<br/>
Happy wherever they go!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the unsearchable riches of Christ!<br/>
Who would not gladly endure<br/>
Trials, afflictions, and crosses on earth,<br/>
Riches like these to secure!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
