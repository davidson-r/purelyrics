<br/>
“Upheld by hope”—a glorious hope<br/>
As days and years roll by;<br/>
The coming of our Lord and King<br/>
Is surely drawing nigh.<br/>
<br/>
“Upheld by hope” all toil is sweet<br/>
With this glad thought in view,<br/>
The Master may appear tonight<br/>
To call His servants true.<br/>
<br/>
“Upheld by hope”—that wondrous hope,<br/>
That I shall see His face,<br/>
And to His likeness be conformed<br/>
When I have run the race.<br/>
<br/>
“Upheld by hope,” in darkest days<br/>
Faith can the light descry:<br/>
The deepening glory in the East<br/>
Proclaims deliverance nigh!<br/>
<br/>
“Upheld by hope,” “Belovèd one,”<br/>
I hear the Bridegroom say,<br/>
“Awake! arise! go forth to meet<br/>
My chariot on its way.”<br/>
<br/>
“Upheld by hope,” how glad the heart!<br/>
My soul is on the wing!<br/>
E’en now His hand is on the door<br/>
He comes—my glorious King!<br/>
