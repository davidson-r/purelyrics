<br/>
God of our youth, to Whom we yield<br/>
The tribute of our eager praise,<br/>
Upon the well contested field,<br/>
And mid the glory of these days,<br/>
God of our youth, be with us yet,<br/>
Lest we forget, lest we forget.<br/>
<br/>
Sturdy of limb, with bounding health,<br/>
Eager to play the heroâ€™s part,<br/>
Grant to us each that greater wealth,<br/>
An undefiled and loyal heart,<br/>
God of our youth, be Thou our might,<br/>
To do the right, to do the right.<br/>
<br/>
When from the field of mimic strife,<br/>
Of strength with strength, and speed with speed,<br/>
We face the sterner fights of life,<br/>
As then our strength in time of need,<br/>
God of our youth, inspire us still,<br/>
To do Thy will, to do Thy will.<br/>
