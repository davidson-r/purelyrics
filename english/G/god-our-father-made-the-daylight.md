<br/>
God, our Father, made the daylight;<br/>
God, our Father, made the night;<br/>
God made mountains, sea, and sky,<br/>
And the white clouds floating high.<br/>
<br/>
God, we thank Thee for the showers;<br/>
God, we thank Thee for the dew,<br/>
Mighty trees and flowers small;<br/>
God, our Father, gave them all.<br/>
