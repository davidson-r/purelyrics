Glad tidings! Glad Tidings! O wonderful love!<br/>
A message has come from our Father above;<br/>
â€™Tis Jesus who brought it to young and to old,<br/>
A message of mercy more precious than gold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glad tidings, glad tidings!<br/>
O wonderful, wonderful, wonderful love!<br/>
Glad tidings, glad tidings!<br/>
We hail the glad tidings of wonderful love.<br/>
<br/>
He saith to the weary, O come unto Me;<br/>
The poor and the lowly His glory may see;<br/>
He blesseth the meek with His soul-cheering voice;<br/>
He comforts the mourners and bids them rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How happy are they who believe in the Lord,<br/>
And love the sweet counsel they find in His Word!<br/>
Be ready to hear, and be swift to obey,<br/>
And follow His steps in the bright shining way.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
