Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Evergreen have its branches been,<br/>
It is king of all the woodland scene;<br/>
For Christ our King is born today!<br/>
His reign shall never pass away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hosanna, hosanna,<br/>
Hosanna in the highest!<br/>
<br/>
Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Once the pride of the mountainside,<br/>
Now cut down to grace our Christmastide;<br/>
For Christ from Heav’n to earth came down,<br/>
To gain, through death, a nobler crown.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Gather around the Christmas tree!<br/>
Every bough bears a burden now—<br/>
They are gifts of love for us, we trow;<br/>
For Christ is born, His love to show,<br/>
And give good gifts to men below.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Farewell to thee, O Christmas tree!<br/>
Farewell to thee, O Christmas tree!<br/>
Twelve months o’er, we shall meet once more,<br/>
Merry welcome singing, as of yore,<br/>
For Christ now reigns, our Savior dear,<br/>
And gives us Christmas every year!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
