The glory of these forty days<br/>
We celebrate with songs of praise;<br/>
For Christ, by Whom all things were made,<br/>
Himself has fasted and has prayed.<br/>
<br/>
Alone and fasting Moses saw<br/>
The loving God Who gave the law;<br/>
And to Elijah, fasting, came<br/>
The steeds and chariots of flame.<br/>
<br/>
So Daniel trained his mystic sight,<br/>
Delivered from the lions’ might;<br/>
And John, the Bridegroom’s friend, became<br/>
The herald of Messiah’s Name.<br/>
<br/>
Then grant us, Lord, like them to be<br/>
Full oft in fast and prayer with Thee;<br/>
Our spirits strengthen with Thy grace,<br/>
And give us joy to see Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, Son, and Spirit blest,<br/>
To thee be every prayer addressed,<br/>
Who art in threefold Name adored,<br/>
From age to age, the only Lord.
