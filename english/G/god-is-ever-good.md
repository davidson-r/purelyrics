<br/>
See the shining dewdrops<br/>
On the flowers strewed,<br/>
Proving as they sparkle,<br/>
“God is ever good,<br/>
Ever good.”<br/>
<br/>
See the morning sunbeams<br/>
Lighting up the wood,<br/>
Silently proclaiming,<br/>
“God is ever good,<br/>
Ever good.”<br/>
<br/>
Hear the mountain streamlet<br/>
In its solitude,<br/>
With its ripple saying,<br/>
“God is ever good,<br/>
Ever good.”<br/>
<br/>
He Who came to save us<br/>
Shed His precious blood;<br/>
Better things it speaketh:<br/>
“God is ever good,<br/>
Ever good.”<br/>
<br/>
Bring, my heart, thy tribute,<br/>
Songs of gratitude;<br/>
All things join to tell us,<br/>
“God is ever good,<br/>
Ever good.”<br/>
