God, Who made the earth,<br/>
The air, the sky, the sea,<br/>
Who gave the light its birth,<br/>
He cares for me.<br/>
<br/>
God, Who made the grass,<br/>
The flow’r, the fruit, the tree,<br/>
The day and night to pass,<br/>
He cares for me.<br/>
<br/>
God, Who made the sun,<br/>
The moon, the stars, is He<br/>
Who, when life’s clouds come on,<br/>
He cares for me.<br/>
<br/>
God, Who made all things,<br/>
On earth, in air, in sea,<br/>
Who if I lean on Him,<br/>
Will care for me.<br/>
<br/>
When in Heav’n’s bright land<br/>
I all His loved ones see,<br/>
I’ll sing with that blest band,<br/>
“God cared for me.”
