God rest ye merry, gentlemen<br/>
Let nothing you dismay<br/>
Remember, Christ, our Saviour<br/>
Was born on Christmas day<br/>
To save us all from Satan's power<br/>
When we were gone astray<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
In Bethlehem, in Israel,<br/>
This blessed Babe was born<br/>
And laid within a manger<br/>
Upon this blessed morn<br/>
The which His Mother Mary<br/>
Did nothing take in scorn<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
From God our Heavenly Father<br/>
A blessed Angel came;<br/>
And unto certain Shepherds<br/>
Brought tidings of the same:<br/>
How that in Bethlehem was born<br/>
The Son of God by Name.<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
"Fear not then," said the Angel,<br/>
"Let nothing you affright,<br/>
This day is born a Saviour<br/>
Of a pure Virgin bright,<br/>
To free all those who trust in Him<br/>
From Satan's power and might."<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
The shepherds at those tidings<br/>
Rejoiced much in mind,<br/>
And left their flocks a-feeding<br/>
In tempest, storm and wind:<br/>
And went to Bethlehem straightway<br/>
The Son of God to find.<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
And when they came to Bethlehem<br/>
Where our dear Saviour lay,<br/>
They found Him in a manger,<br/>
Where oxen feed on hay;<br/>
His Mother Mary kneeling down,<br/>
Unto the Lord did pray.<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Lord sing praises,<br/>
All you within this place,<br/>
And with true love and brotherhood<br/>
Each other now embrace;<br/>
This holy tide of Christmas<br/>
All other doth deface.<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br/>
Comfort and joy<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy.
