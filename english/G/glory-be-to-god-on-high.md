Glory be to God on high,<br/>
God Whose glory fills the skies;<br/>
Peace on earth to man forgiv’n,<br/>
Man, the well beloved of Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Sovereign Father, heavenly King,<br/>
Thee we now presume to sing;<br/>
Glad, Thine attributes confess,<br/>
Glorious all, and numberless.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, by all Thy works adored!<br/>
Hail, the everlasting Lord!<br/>
Thee with thankful hearts we prove<br/>
God of power, and God of love.<br/>
<br/>
Christ our Lord and God we own,<br/>
Christ, the Father’s only Son,<br/>
Lamb of God for sinners slain,<br/>
Savior of offending man.<br/>
<br/>
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,<br/>
Hear, the world’s atonement, Thou!<br/>
Jesus, in Thy Name we pray,<br/>
Take, O take our sins away!<br/>
<br/>
Powerful Advocate with God,<br/>
Justify us by Thy blood;<br/>
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,<br/>
Hear, the world’s atonement, Thou!<br/>
<br/>
Hear, for Thou, O Christ, alone<br/>
Art with God the Father One,<br/>
One the Holy Ghost with Thee,<br/>
One supreme, eternal Three.
