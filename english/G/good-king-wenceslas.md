Good King Wenceslas looked out<br/>
On the feast of Stephen<br/>
When the snow lay round about<br/>
Deep and crisp and even<br/>
Brightly shone the moon that night<br/>
Though the frost was cruel<br/>
When a poor man came in sight<br/>
Gath'ring winter fuel<br/>
<br/>
"Hither, page, and stand by me<br/>
If thou know'st it, telling<br/>
Yonder peasant, who is he?<br/>
Where and what his dwelling?"<br/>
"Sire, he lives a good league hence<br/>
Underneath the mountain<br/>
Right against the forest fence<br/>
By Saint Agnes' fountain."<br/>
<br/>
"Bring me flesh and bring me wine<br/>
Bring me pine logs hither<br/>
Thou and I will see him dine<br/>
When we bear him thither."<br/>
Page and monarch forth they went<br/>
Forth they went together<br/>
Through the rude wind's wild lament<br/>
And the bitter weather<br/>
<br/>
"Sire, the night is darker now<br/>
And the wind blows stronger<br/>
Fails my heart, I know not how,<br/>
I can go no longer."<br/>
"Mark my footsteps, my good page<br/>
Tread thou in them boldly<br/>
Thou shalt find the winter's rage<br/>
Freeze thy blood less coldly."<br/>
<br/>
In his master's steps he trod<br/>
Where the snow lay dinted<br/>
Heat was in the very sod<br/>
Which the Saint had printed<br/>
Therefore, Christian men, be sure<br/>
Wealth or rank possessing<br/>
Ye who now will bless the poor<br/>
Shall yourselves find blessing.
