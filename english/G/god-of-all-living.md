God of all living,<br/>
Father, we praise you,<br/>
Full of thanksgiving,<br/>
For so much love;<br/>
Now in this wedding,<br/>
Come down among us,<br/>
Pour out your blessing,<br/>
Heavenly Dove.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect companion,<br/>
God's gift in marriage,<br/>
One true communion,<br/>
Help on life's way;<br/>
May we be mindful,<br/>
In need and plenty,<br/>
May we be faithful<br/>
Every new day.<br/>
<br/>
With love's true splendour,<br/>
Father, delight us,<br/>
Each giving honour,<br/>
With faithfulness;<br/>
And may the sharing<br/>
Of this sweet union<br/>
Deepen our caring,<br/>
With tenderness.<br/>
<br/>
May there be children,<br/>
Fruit of our loving,<br/>
True men and women,<br/>
With faith beside;<br/>
Grant us your keeping<br/>
In all our future,<br/>
Your love caressing<br/>
Bridegroom and bride.<br/>
