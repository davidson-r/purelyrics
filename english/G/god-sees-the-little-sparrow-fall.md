<center>
God sees the little sparrow fall,<br/>
It meets His tender view;<br/>
If God so loves the little birds,<br/>
I know He loves me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He loves me, too, He loves me, too,<br/>
I know He loves me, too;<br/>
Because He loves the little things,<br/>
I know He loves me, too.<br/>
<br/>
He paints the lily of the field,<br/>
Perfumes each lily bell;<br/>
If He so loves the little flow’rs,<br/>
I know He loves me well.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God made the little birds and flow’rs,<br/>
And all things large and small;<br/>
He’ll not forget his little ones,<br/>
I know He loves them all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
