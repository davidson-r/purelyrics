title: Gospel Echoes

<br/>
The Gospel message sent—<br/>
Is echoed back again,<br/>
From lips in prayer and praise,<br/>
And this the sweet refrain:<br/>
That Jesus died for me—<br/>
Dear Lamb of Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
The echo from each heart,<br/>
In answer to the call—<br/>
Is “Here am I, O Lord—<br/>
Lo! at Thy feet I fall;<br/>
Thou Lamb of Calvary,<br/>
I trust alone in Thee.”<br/>
<br/>
Its echoing strains are heard<br/>
From palace and from cot—<br/>
From lips of age and youth—<br/>
His blood can cleanse each spot;<br/>
Dear Lamb of Calvary,<br/>
I come, I come to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let the Gospel sound<br/>
In all the land abroad,<br/>
And send the echo round,<br/>
In honor of our Lord—<br/>
The Lamb of Calvary,<br/>
Has died to ransom Thee.<br/>
