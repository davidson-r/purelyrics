<center>
Glorious Yuletide, glad bells proclaim it,<br/>
Children extol its joys in jubilant throng.<br/>
Come, all ye people, join in our gladness,<br/>
Loud ring our praises in sacred song.<br/>
<br/>
Onward to Bethlehem, follow the shepherds,<br/>
Gather around the lowly manger and stall.<br/>
Join with the angels, welcome the Savior<br/>
Born in the flesh to be Lord of all.<br/>
<br/>
Onward to Bethlehem, follow the wise men,<br/>
Come from afar with their gifts and homage to bring.<br/>
Sweeter than incense, prized more than jewels,<br/>
Hearts true and loyal unto the King!
