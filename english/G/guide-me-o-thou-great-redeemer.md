title: Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer

Guide me, O thou great redeemer,<br/>
Pilgrim through this barren land;<br/>
I am weak, but thou art mighty,<br/>
Hold me with thy powerful hand;<br/>
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven<br/>
Feed me till I want no more;<br/>
Feed me till I want no more.<br/>
<br/>
Open now the crystal fountain<br/>
Whence the healing stream doth flow;<br/>
Let the fire and cloudy pillar<br/>
Lead me all my journey through:<br/>
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer;<br/>
Be thou still my strength and shield;<br/>
Be thou still my strength and shield.<br/>
<br/>
When I tread the verge of Jordan,<br/>
Bid my anxious fears subside;<br/>
Death of death, and hell's destruction<br/>
Land me safe on Canaan's side:<br/>
Songs of praises, songs of praises,<br/>
I will ever give to thee;<br/>
I will ever give to thee.
