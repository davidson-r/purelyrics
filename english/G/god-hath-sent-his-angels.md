title: God Hath Sent His Angels

<center>
God hath sent His angels to the earth again,<br/>
Bringing joyful tidings to the sons of men;<br/>
They who first at Christmas thronged the heavenly way,<br/>
Now beside the tomb door sit on Easter day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Angels, sing His triumph as you sang His birth,<br/>
“Christ the Lord is risen, peace, goodwill on earth!”<br/>
<br/>
In the dreadful desert, where the Lord was tried,<br/>
There the faithful angels gathered at His side;<br/>
And when, in the garden, grief and pain and care<br/>
Bowed Him down with anguish, they were with Him there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yet the Christ they honor is the same Christ still<br/>
Who, in light and darkness, did His Father’s will;<br/>
And the tomb, deserted, shineth like the sky,<br/>
Since He passed from out it, into victory.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God has still His angels, helping at His word,<br/>
All His faithful children, like their faithful Lord;<br/>
Soothing them in sorrow, arming them in strife,<br/>
Opening wide the tomb doors, leading into life.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
