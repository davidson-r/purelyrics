<br/>
Glory to Thee, O Lord,<br/>
Who, from this world of sin,<br/>
By cruel Herod’s ruthless sword<br/>
Those precious ones didst win.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized in their own blood,<br/>
Earth’s untried perils o’er,<br/>
They passed unconsciously the flood,<br/>
And safely gained the shore.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to Thee for all<br/>
The ransomed infant band,<br/>
Who, since that hour have heard Thy call,<br/>
And reached the quiet land.<br/>
<br/>
O that our hearts within,<br/>
Like theirs, were pure and bright,<br/>
O that as free from stain of sin<br/>
We shrank not from Thy sight.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, help us every hour<br/>
Thy cleansing grace to claim;<br/>
In life to glorify Thy power,<br/>
In death to praise Thy Name.<br/>
