Good Christian men rejoice<br/>
With heart and soul and voice!<br/>
Give ye heed to what we say<br/>
News! News!<br/>
Jesus Christ is born today!<br/>
Ox and ass before Him bow<br/>
And He is in the manger now<br/>
Christ is born today!<br/>
Christ is born today!<br/>
<br/>
Good Christian men, rejoice<br/>
With heart and soul and voice<br/>
Now ye hear of endless bliss<br/>
Joy! Joy!<br/>
Jesus Christ was born for this<br/>
He hath ope'd the heav'nly door<br/>
And man is blessed evermore<br/>
Christ was born for this<br/>
Christ was born for this<br/>
<br/>
Good Christian men, rejoice<br/>
With heart and soul and voice<br/>
Now ye need not fear the grave:<br/>
Peace! Peace!<br/>
Jesus Christ was born to save<br/>
Calls you one and calls you all<br/>
To gain His everlasting hall<br/>
Christ was born to save<br/>
Christ was born to save.<br/>
