Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,<br/>
Pilgrim through this barren land.<br/>
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;<br/>
Hold me with Thy powerful hand.<br/>
Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven,<br/>
Feed me till I want no more;<br/>
Feed me till I want no more.<br/>
<br/>
Open now the crystal fountain,<br/>
Whence the healing stream doth flow;<br/>
Let the fire and cloudy pillar<br/>
Lead me all my journey through.<br/>
Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer,<br/>
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield;<br/>
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I trust Thy mighty power,<br/>
Wondrous are Thy works of old;<br/>
Thou deliver’st Thine from thralldom,<br/>
Who for naught themselves had sold:<br/>
Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer,<br/>
Sin, and Satan and the grave,<br/>
Sin, and Satan and the grave.<br/>
<br/>
When I tread the verge of Jordan,<br/>
Bid my anxious fears subside;<br/>
Death of deaths, and hell’s destruction,<br/>
Land me safe on Canaan’s side.<br/>
Songs of praises, songs of praises,<br/>
I will ever give to Thee;<br/>
I will ever give to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Musing on my habitation,<br/>
Musing on my heav’nly home,<br/>
Fills my soul with holy longings:<br/>
Come, my Jesus, quickly come;<br/>
Vanity is all I see;<br/>
Lord, I long to be with Thee!<br/>
Lord, I long to be with Thee!
