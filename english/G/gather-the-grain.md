<br/>
O list to the music that floats on the air,<br/>
The valleys are smiling, the reapers are there;<br/>
The summer rewards us with plenty again;<br/>
Then thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gather the grain, gather the grain;<br/>
Thanks for the sunshine, the dew, and the rain;<br/>
Sunshine is yielding its harvest again,<br/>
Then thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.<br/>
<br/>
O why should we tarry from labor today?<br/>
The reapers are calling, and we must away;<br/>
The sky is unclouded and soft is the wind;<br/>
The bright sheaves are waving and ready to bind.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We ask of the Master, our strength to renew,<br/>
Tho’ great is the harvest, the toilers are few;<br/>
We pray that to others His grace He may give,<br/>
To work and be faithful as long as they live.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The harvest is passing, to greet us no more,<br/>
The summer is ending, and soon will be o’er;<br/>
Our moments neglected, return not again—<br/>
Now thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
