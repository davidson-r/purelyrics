<br/>
Go to dark Gethsemane, ye that feel the tempter’s power;<br/>
Your Redeemer’s conflict see, watch with Him one bitter hour,<br/>
Turn not from His griefs away; learn of Jesus Christ to pray.<br/>
<br/>
See Him at the judgment hall, beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;<br/>
O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sustained!<br/>
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn of Christ to bear the cross.<br/>
<br/>
Calvary’s mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at His feet,<br/>
Mark that miracle of time, God’s own sacrifice complete.<br/>
“It is finished!” hear Him cry; learn of Jesus Christ to die.<br/>
<br/>
Early hasten to the tomb where they laid His breathless clay;<br/>
All is solitude and gloom. Who has taken Him away?<br/>
Christ is risen! He meets our eyes; Savior, teach us so to rise.<br/>
