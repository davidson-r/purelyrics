<br/>
God save our gracious Queen, <br/>
Long live our noble Queen, <br/>
God save the Queen: <br/>
Send her victorious, <br/>
Happy and glorious, <br/>
Long to reign over us: <br/>
God save the Queen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, our God, arise, <br/>
Scatter her enemies, <br/>
And make them fall. <br/>
Confound their politics, <br/>
Frustrate their knavish tricks, <br/>
On thee our hopes we fix: <br/>
God save the Queen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thy choicest gifts in store, <br/>
On her be pleased to pour; <br/>
Long may she reign: <br/>
May she defend our laws, <br/>
And ever give us cause <br/>
To sing with heart and voice <br/>
God save the Queen <br/>
<br/>
From every latent foe, <br/>
From the assassins blow, <br/>
God save the Queen! <br/>
O'er her thine arm extend, <br/>
For Britain's sake defend, <br/>
Our mother, prince, and friend, <br/>
God save the Queen!<br/>
