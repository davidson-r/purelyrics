title: God The Father Whose Creation

<center>
God the Father! Whose creation<br/>
Gives to flowers and fruits their birth,<br/>
Thou, Whose yearly operation<br/>
Brings the hour of harvest mirth,<br/>
Here to Thee we make oblation<br/>
Of the August-gold of earth.<br/>
<br/>
God the Word! the sun, maturing<br/>
With his blessèd ray the corn,<br/>
Spake of Thee, O Sun enduring,<br/>
Thee, O everlasting Morn!<br/>
Thee in Whom our woes find curing<br/>
Thee that liftest up our horn.<br/>
<br/>
God the Holy Ghost! the showers<br/>
That have fattened out the grain,<br/>
Types of Thy celestial powers,<br/>
Symbols of baptismal rain,<br/>
Shadowed out the grace that dowers<br/>
All the faithful of Thy train.<br/>
<br/>
When the harvest of each nation<br/>
Severs righteousness from sin,<br/>
And archangel proclamation<br/>
Bids to put the sickle in,<br/>
And each age and generation<br/>
Sink to woe, or glory win;<br/>
<br/>
Grant that we, or young, or hoary,<br/>
Lengthened be our span or brief,<br/>
Whatsoe’er the life long story<br/>
Of our joy or of our grief,<br/>
May be garnered up in glory<br/>
As Thine own elected sheaf.<br/>
<br/>
Laud to Him to Whom supernal<br/>
Thrones and virtues bend the knee;<br/>
Laud to Him from Whom infernal<br/>
Powers and dominations flee;<br/>
Laud to Him the co-eternal<br/>
Paraclete, forever be.
