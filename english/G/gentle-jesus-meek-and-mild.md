Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,<br/>
Look upon a little child;<br/>
Pity my simplicity,<br/>
Suffer me to come to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Lamb of God, I look to Thee;<br/>
Thou shalt my Example be;<br/>
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild;<br/>
Thou wast once a little child.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I would be as Thou art;<br/>
Give me Thine obedient heart;<br/>
Thou art pitiful and kind,<br/>
Let me have Thy loving mind.<br/>
<br/>
Let me, above all, fulfill<br/>
God my heav’nly Father’s will;<br/>
Never His good Spirit grieve;<br/>
Only to His glory live.<br/>
<br/>
Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,<br/>
In Thy gracious hands I am;<br/>
Make me, Savior, what Thou art,<br/>
Live Thyself within my heart.
