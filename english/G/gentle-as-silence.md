title: Gentle As Silence

<br/>
Oh, the love of my Lord is the essence<br/>
Of all that I love here on earth.<br/>
All the beauty I see, He has given to me,<br/>
And his giving is gentle as silence.<br/>
<br/>
Every day, every hour, every moment,<br/>
Have been blessed by the strength of His love.<br/>
At the turn of each tide, He is there at my side,<br/>
And his touch is as gentle as silence.<br/>
<br/>
There've been times when I've turned from his presence,<br/>
And I've walked other paths, other ways,<br/>
But I've called on his name, in the dark of my shame<br/>
And his mercy was gentle as silence.<br/>
