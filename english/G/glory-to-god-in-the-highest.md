<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Glory to God! Glory to God!<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Shall be our song today;<br/>
Another yearâ€™s rich mercies prove<br/>
His ceaseless care and boundless love;<br/>
So let our loudest voices raise<br/>
Our glad and grateful song of praise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br/>
Glory be to God on high!<br/>
Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br/>
Glory be to God on high!<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Glory to God! Glory to God!<br/>
Glory to God in the highest!<br/>
Shall be our song today;<br/>
O, may we, an unbroken band,<br/>
Around the throne of Jesus stand,<br/>
And there with angels and the throng<br/>
Of His redeemed ones, join the song.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
