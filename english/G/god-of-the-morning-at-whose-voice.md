<br/>
God of the morning, at Whose voice<br/>
The cheerful sun makes haste to rise,<br/>
And like a giant doth rejoice<br/>
To run his journey through the skies.<br/>
<br/>
From the fair chambers of the east<br/>
The circuit of his race begins,<br/>
And, without weariness or rest,<br/>
Round the whole earth he flies and shines.<br/>
<br/>
O like the sun may I fulfill<br/>
Th’appointed duties of the day,<br/>
With ready mind and active will<br/>
March on and keep my heav’nly way.<br/>
<br/>
But I shall rove and lose the race,<br/>
If God, my Sun, should disappear,<br/>
And leave me in this world’s wild maze,<br/>
To follow every wand’ring star.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, Thy commands are clean and pure,<br/>
Enlight’ning our beclouded eyes;<br/>
Thy threat’nings just, Thy promise sure,<br/>
Thy Gospel makes the simple wise.<br/>
<br/>
Give me Thy counsel for my guide,<br/>
And then receive me to Thy bliss;<br/>
All my desires and hopes beside<br/>
Are faint and cold compared with this.<br/>
