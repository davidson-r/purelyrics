title: Great Forerunner Of The Morn

The great forerunner of the morn,<br/>
The herald of the Word, is born:<br/>
And faithful hearts shall never fail<br/>
With thanks and praise his light to hail.<br/>
<br/>
With heavenly message Gabriel came,<br/>
That John should be that herald’s name,<br/>
And with prophetic utterance told<br/>
His actions great and manifold.<br/>
<br/>
John, still unborn, yet gave aright<br/>
His witness to the coming Light;<br/>
And Christ, the Sun of all of all the earth,<br/>
Fulfilled that witness at His birth.<br/>
<br/>
Of woman born shall never be<br/>
A greater prophet than was he,<br/>
Whose mighty deeds exalt his fame<br/>
To greater than a prophet’s name.<br/>
<br/>
But why should mortal accents raise<br/>
The hymn of John the Baptist’s praise?<br/>
Of whom, or e’er his course was run,<br/>
Thus spake the Father to the Son?<br/>
<br/>
“Behold, My herald, who shall go<br/>
Before Thy face Thy way to show,<br/>
And shine, as with the day-star’s gleam,<br/>
Before Thine own eternal beam.”<br/>
<br/>
All praise to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,<br/>
Whom with the Spirit we adore<br/>
Forever and forevermore.<br/>
