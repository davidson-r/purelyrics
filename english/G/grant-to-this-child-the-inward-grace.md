title: Grant To This Child The Inward Grace

<center>
<br/>
Grant to this child the inward grace,<br/>
While we the outward sign impart;<br/>
The cross we on his forehead trace<br/>
Do Thou engrave upon his heart.<br/>
<br/>
May it his pride and glory be,<br/>
Beneath Thy banner fair unfurled,<br/>
To march to certain victory<br/>
O’er sin, o’er Satan, o’er the world.<br/>

</center>
