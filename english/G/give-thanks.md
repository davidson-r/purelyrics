O give thanks, give thanks unto the Lord,<br/>
For He is good, and His mercy endureth forever.<br/>
To Him which led His people through the wilderness,<br/>
For He is good, and His mercy endureth forever.<br/>
He turnèd the wilderness into a standing water,<br/>
And dry ground into water springs.<br/>
Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees,<br/>
Say to them that are of a fearful heart,<br/>
Be strong, fear not, behold your God will come with a recompense.<br/>
Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened<br/>
And the ears of the deaf, of the deaf unstoppèd.<br/>
And a highway shall be there,<br/>
And it shall be callèd the way, the way of holiness,<br/>
The unclean shall not pass over it,<br/>
The unclean shall not pass over it,<br/>
But the redeemèd of the Lord shall walk therein;<br/>
And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion,<br/>
To Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads,<br/>
They shall obtain joy and gladness,<br/>
And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
