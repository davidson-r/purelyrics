God of the living, in Whose eyes<br/>
Unveiled Thy whole creation lies,<br/>
All souls are Thine, we must not say<br/>
That those are dead who pass away;<br/>
From this our world of flesh set free,<br/>
We know them living unto Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Released from earthly toil and strife,<br/>
With Thee is hidden still their life;<br/>
Thine are their thoughts, their works, their powers,<br/>
All Thine, and yet most truly ours;<br/>
For well we know, where’er they be,<br/>
Our dead are living unto Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Not spilt like water on the ground,<br/>
Not wrapped in dreamless sleep profound,<br/>
Not wandering in unknown despair,<br/>
Beyond Thy voice, Thine Arm, Thy care;<br/>
Not left to lie like fallen tree—<br/>
Not dead, but living, unto Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thy Word is true, Thy will is just;<br/>
To Thee we leave them, Lord, in trust;<br/>
And bless Thee for the love which gave<br/>
Thy Son to fill a human grave;<br/>
That none might fear that world to see<br/>
Where all are living unto Thee.<br/>
<br/>
O Breather into man of breath,<br/>
O Holder of the keys of death,<br/>
O Giver of the life within,<br/>
Save us from death, the death of sin,<br/>
That body, soul, and spirit be<br/>
Forever living unto Thee.
