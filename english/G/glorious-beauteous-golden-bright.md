Glorious, beauteous, golden-bright,<br/>
Shedding softest, purest light,<br/>
Shone the stars that Christmas night,<br/>
When the Jewish shepherds kept<br/>
Watch beside their flocks that slept.<br/>
<br/>
But the stars’ sweet golden gleam<br/>
Faded quickly as a dream<br/>
’Mid the wondrous glory-stream<br/>
That illumined all the earth,<br/>
When Christ’s angels sang His birth.<br/>
<br/>
Soft and pure and holy glory,<br/>
Kings and seers and prophets hoary,<br/>
Shed throughout the sacred story:<br/>
While the priests, like shepherds true,<br/>
Watched beside God’s chosen few.<br/>
<br/>
But that light no more availéd,<br/>
And its splendor staighway paléd<br/>
In His light Whom angels hailéd;<br/>
Even as the stars of old,<br/>
’Mid the brightness lost their gold.<br/>
<br/>
Now no more on Christmas night,<br/>
Is the sky with angels bright,<br/>
But for ever shines the Light;<br/>
Even He Whose birth they told<br/>
To the shepherds by the fold.<br/>
<br/>
Since that Light then darkens never,<br/>
Let us all, with glad endeavor,<br/>
Sing the song that echoes ever:<br/>
Glory in the highest Heaven!<br/>
Peace on earth to us forgiven.
