<center>
Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,<br/>
Our little ones are dear to Thee;<br/>
Gathered with Thine arms and carried<br/>
In Thy bosom may they be<br/>
Sweetly, gently, safely tended,<br/>
From all want and danger free.<br/>
<br/>
Tender Shepherd, never leave them<br/>
From Thy fold to go astray;<br/>
By Thy look of love directed,<br/>
May they walk the narrow way;<br/>
Thus direct them, and protect them,<br/>
Lest they fall an easy prey.<br/>
<br/>
Let Thy holy Word instruct them:<br/>
Fill their minds with heav’nly light;<br/>
Let Thy love and grace constrain them,<br/>
To approve whate’er is right,<br/>
Take Thine easy yoke and wear it,<br/>
And to prove Thy burden light.<br/>
<br/>
Cleanse their hearts from sinful folly<br/>
In the stream Thy love supplied;<br/>
Mingled streams of blood and water<br/>
Flowing from Thy wounded side;<br/>
And to heav’nly pastures lead them,<br/>
Where Thine own still waters glide.
