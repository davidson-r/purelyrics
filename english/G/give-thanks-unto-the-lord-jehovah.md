<br/>
Give thanks unto the Lord, Jehovah,<br/>
For He is good, O praise His Name!<br/>
Let Israel say: The Lord be praisèd,<br/>
His mercy ever is the same.<br/>
Let Aaron’s house now praise Jehovah;<br/>
The Lord is good, O praise His Name:<br/>
Let all that fear the Lord extol Him,<br/>
His mercy ever is the same.<br/>
<br/>
In a large place the Lord hath set me;<br/>
In my distress He heard my cry.<br/>
I will not fear, the Lord is with me;<br/>
What can man do, when God is nigh?<br/>
The Lord is chief among my helpers;<br/>
And I shall see my foes o’erthrown:<br/>
Far better than in man or princes,<br/>
My trust I place in God alone.<br/>
<br/>
I shall not die, but live, declaring<br/>
The works of God, Who tried me sore,<br/>
And chastened me; but in His mercy<br/>
Not unto death has giv’n me o’er.<br/>
The gates of righteousness set open,<br/>
The gate of God! I’ll enter in<br/>
To praise Thee, Lord, Who prayer hast answered,<br/>
And savèdst me from all my sin.<br/>
<br/>
The stone O Lord, it is Thy doing<br/>
The stone the builders did despise,<br/>
Is made the headstone of the corner,<br/>
And it is marv’lous in our eyes.<br/>
This is the day, of days most glorious,<br/>
The Lord has made; we’ll joy and sing.<br/>
Send now prosperity, we pray Thee;<br/>
And, O our God, salvation bring!<br/>
