Gabriel’s message does away<br/>
Satan’s curse and Satan’s sway;<br/>
This was wrought by Christmas Day:<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
He that comes despised shall reign;<br/>
He that cannot die, be slain;<br/>
Death by death its death shall gain:<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
Like its like shall overthrow:<br/>
By a Tree prevailed the foe;<br/>
From a Tree shall healing grow:<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
Man was lost a garden in;<br/>
In a garden man shall win;<br/>
Woman’s faith end woman’s sin:<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
Weakness shall the strong confound;<br/>
By the hands, in babe-clothes wound,<br/>
Adam’s sin shall be unbound;<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
By the sword that was his own<br/>
By that sword, and that alone;<br/>
Shall Goliath be o’erthrown;<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
<br/>
Art by art shall be assailed;<br/>
To the cross shall Life be nailed;<br/>
From the grave shall hope be hailed;<br/>
Therefore sing—Glory to the Infant King!<br/>
