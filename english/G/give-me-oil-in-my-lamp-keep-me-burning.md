Give me oil in my lamp keep me burning<br/>
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray,<br/>
Give my oil in my lamp, keep me burning,<br/>
Keep me burning 'till the end of day.<br/>
<br/>
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,<br/>
Sing hosanna to the King of kings!<br/>
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,<br/>
Sing hosanna to the King!<br/>
<br/>
Give me peace in my heart, keep me resting,<br/>
Give me peace in my heart, I pray.<br/>
Give me peace in my heart, keep me resting,<br/>
Keep me resting 'till the end of day. <br/>
<br/>
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,<br/>
Sing hosanna to the King of kings!<br/>
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna,<br/>
Sing hosanna to the King!
