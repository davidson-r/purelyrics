<br/>
When comes to the weary a blessèd release,<br/>
When upward we pass to His kingdom of peace,<br/>
When free from the woes that on earth we must bear,<br/>
We’ll say “good night” here, but “good morning” up there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Good morning up there where Christ is the Light,<br/>
Good morning up there where cometh no night;<br/>
When we step from this earth to God’s Heaven so fair,<br/>
We’ll say “good night” here but “good morning” up there.<br/>
<br/>
When fadeth the day and dark shadows draw nigh,<br/>
With Christ close at hand, it is not death to die;<br/>
He’ll wipe every tear, roll away every care;<br/>
We’ll say “good night” here, but “good morning” up there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When home lights we see shining brightly above,<br/>
Where we shall be soon, through His wonderful love,<br/>
We’ll praise Him Who called us His Heaven to share,<br/>
We’ll say “good night” here, but “good morning” up there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
