title: Gentle Mary laid her child

<center>
Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger;<br/>
There He lay, the undefiled, to the world a Stranger:<br/>
Such a Babe in such a place, can He be the Savior?<br/>
Ask the saved of all the race who have found His favor.<br/>
<br/>
Angels sang about His birth; wise men sought and found Him;<br/>
Heavenâ€™s star shone brightly forth, glory all around Him:<br/>
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, heard the angels singing;<br/>
All the plains were lit that night, all the hills were ringing.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger;<br/>
He is still the undefiled, but no more a stranger:<br/>
Son of God, of humble birth, beautiful the story;<br/>
Praise His Name in all the earth, hail the King of glory!
