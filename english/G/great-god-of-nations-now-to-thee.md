<br/>
Great God of nations, now to Thee<br/>
Our hymn of gratitude we raise;<br/>
With humble heart and bending knee<br/>
We offer Thee our song of praise.<br/>
<br/>
Thy Name we bless, Almighty God,<br/>
For all the kindness Thou hast shown<br/>
To this fair land the pilgrims trod,<br/>
This land we fondly call our own.<br/>
<br/>
Here freedom spreads her banner wide<br/>
And casts her soft and hallowed ray;<br/>
Here Thou our fathers’ steps didst guide<br/>
In safety through their dangerous way.<br/>
<br/>
We praise Thee that the Gospel’s light<br/>
Through all our land its radiance sheds,<br/>
Dispels the shades of error’s night,<br/>
And heavenly blessings round us spreads.<br/>
<br/>
Great God, preserve us in Thy fear;<br/>
In danger still our Guardian be;<br/>
O spread Thy truth’s bright precepts here;<br/>
Let all the people worship Thee.<br/>
