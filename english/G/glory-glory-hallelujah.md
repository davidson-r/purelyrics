<br/>
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;<br/>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br/>
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;<br/>
His truth is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps<br/>
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;<br/>
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;<br/>
His day is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;<br/>
“As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal”;<br/>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,<br/>
Since God is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;<br/>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;<br/>
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;<br/>
Our God is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,<br/>
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:<br/>
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;<br/>
[originally …let us die to make men free]<br/>
While God is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,<br/>
He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave;<br/>
So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave,<br/>
Our God is marching on.<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.<br/>
