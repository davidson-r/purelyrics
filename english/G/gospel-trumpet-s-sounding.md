<br/>
The Gospel trumpet’s sounding,<br/>
The year of jubilee,<br/>
And grace is all abounding,<br/>
To set the bondmen free.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Return, return, ye captives,<br/>
Return unto your home,<br/>
The Gospel trumpet’s sounding,<br/>
The jubilee is come!<br/>
The Gospel trumpet’s sounding,<br/>
The jubilee is come!<br/>
<br/>
Forsake your wretched service,<br/>
Your master’s claims are o’er;<br/>
Avail yourselves of freedom,<br/>
Be Satan’s slaves no more.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A better Master’s calling,<br/>
In accents true and kind;<br/>
He asks a loving service,<br/>
And claims a willing mind.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He offers you salvation,<br/>
And points to joys above;<br/>
And, longing, waits to make you<br/>
The objects of His love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In living faith accept Him,<br/>
Give up all ease beside;<br/>
While grace is loudly calling,<br/>
Look to the Crucified.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
