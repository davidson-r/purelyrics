Glad Christmas bells, your music tells<br/>
The sweet and pleasant story;<br/>
How came to earth, in lowly birth,<br/>
The Lord of life and glory.<br/>
<br/>
No palace hall its ceiling tall<br/>
His kingly head spread over,<br/>
There only stood a stable rude<br/>
The heavenly Babe to cover.<br/>
<br/>
No raiment gay, as there He lay,<br/>
Adorned the infant Stranger;<br/>
Poor, humble Child of mother mild,<br/>
She laid Him in a manger.<br/>
<br/>
But from afar, a splendid star<br/>
The wise men westward turning;<br/>
The livelong night saw pure and bright,<br/>
Above His birth place burning.
