Great God and Saviour, on this Easter day<br/>
Gathered in Thy presence, we Thy children pray;<br/>
Make our praises incense, waft them all around<br/>
As we lift our voices, this the joyful sound:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’re here to praise You, Resurrection Day<br/>
Fill us with Your Spirit, speak, O Lord, we pray.<br/>
<br/>
Angels announce Him, Jesus is the Lord and Christ<br/>
Source of our redemption, centre of our tryst;<br/>
He the Way has opened so that sinners we<br/>
Find through Him our pardon, peace and purity.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Death hides no terrors, naught can separate<br/>
Thou the conqu’ring Saviour we appreciate;<br/>
Worshipping before Thee, in Thy righteousness<br/>
Thy death hath procured this, Thee we gladly bless.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Here then is Jesus, sound His praises long,<br/>
Blend them all together, sing them in a song.<br/>
Make them loud and joyful, ‘Resurrection Day’<br/>
Christ is all victorious, nothing more to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
