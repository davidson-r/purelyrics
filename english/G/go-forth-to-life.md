title: Go Forth To Life

<br/>
Go forth to life, O child of earth!<br/>
Still mindful of thy heav’nly birth;<br/>
Thou art not here for ease, or sin,<br/>
But manhood’s noble crown to win.<br/>
<br/>
Tho’ passion’s fires are in thy soul,<br/>
Thy spirit can their flames control;<br/>
Tho’ tempters strong beset thy way,<br/>
Thy spirit is more strong than they.<br/>
<br/>
Go on from innocence of youth<br/>
To manly purity and truth;<br/>
God’s angels still are near to save,<br/>
And God Himself doth help the brave.<br/>
<br/>
Then forth to life, O child of earth!<br/>
Be worthy of thy heav’nly birth!<br/>
For noble service thou art here;<br/>
Thy brothers help, thy God revere!<br/>
