<br/>
Come, let us all unite to sing:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
Let Heav’n and earth their praises bring,<br/>
God is love!<br/>
Let every soul from sin awake,<br/>
Let every heart sweet music make,<br/>
And sing with us for Jesus’ sake:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God is love! God is love!<br/>
Come let us all unite to sing that God is love.<br/>
<br/>
O tell to earth’s remotest bound,<br/>
God is love!<br/>
In Christ we have redemption found,<br/>
God is love!<br/>
His blood has washed our sins away,<br/>
His Spirit turned our night to day,<br/>
And now we can rejoice to say:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How happy is our portion here,<br/>
God is love!<br/>
His promises our spirits cheer,<br/>
God is love!<br/>
He is our sun and shield by day,<br/>
Our help, our hope, our strength and stay;<br/>
He will be with us all the way;<br/>
God is love!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In Canaan we will sing again:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
And this shall be our loudest strain:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
Whilst endless ages roll along,<br/>
We’ll triumph with the heavenly throng<br/>
And this shall be our sweetest song:<br/>
God is love!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
