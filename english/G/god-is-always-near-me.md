title: God is Always Near Me

<br/>
God is always near me,<br/>
Hearing what I say;<br/>
Knowing all my thoughts and deeds,<br/>
All my work and play.<br/>
<br/>
God is always near me,<br/>
In the darkest night,<br/>
He can see me just the same<br/>
As by midday light.<br/>
<br/>
God is always near me,<br/>
Though so young and small;<br/>
Not a look, or word, or thought,<br/>
But God knows it all.<br/>
