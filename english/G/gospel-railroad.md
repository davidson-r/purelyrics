<br/>
Heard you not that railroad whistle?<br/>
Lo, the Gospel train is here.<br/>
Get aboard, ye earth-worn pilgrims,<br/>
She is safe, there’s naught to fear.<br/>
She is built of God’s own timbers,<br/>
Coaches ample and complete;<br/>
Rails are laid in faith and patience,<br/>
And each tie a promise sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All aboard the Gospel railroad.<br/>
All aboard, ere ’tis too late;<br/>
We are bound for Heaven’s depot,<br/>
Where the angel porters wait.<br/>
<br/>
Storm-tossed sinner o’er life’s billow,<br/>
Come on board this train today;<br/>
There are stations rich in blessing<br/>
Scattered all along the way.<br/>
Get your ticket, God’s forgiveness;<br/>
Jesus paid the fare, you know,<br/>
And His telegrams of mercy<br/>
Up and down this railroad go.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’re equipped in Gospel armor<br/>
For the conflicts by the way,<br/>
And our food is heav’nly manna<br/>
God dispenses day by day.<br/>
Oh the richness of His mercy;<br/>
How it satisfies and saves!<br/>
While the banner of salvation<br/>
O’er our railroad proudly waves.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’ve a brave and true Conductor,<br/>
And the Bible is our guide;<br/>
And the Holy Ghost supplies us<br/>
With our “moving power” beside.<br/>
All the brakemen are God’s servants,<br/>
Standing firm at duty’s post,<br/>
Carrying trainloads into Canaan—<br/>
Lo, a great unnumbered host.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
See the Gospel headlight streaming<br/>
Far adown our foremost track,<br/>
To disclose the open switches<br/>
Satan leaves to hurl us back.<br/>
He may plan wrecks and disasters,<br/>
To derail or ditch our train,<br/>
But we’ll make the run successful;<br/>
All his efforts prove in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lo, our Engineer keeps sighting<br/>
Down the track with eagle eye,<br/>
If perchance some threatening danger<br/>
Half concealed may near us lie.<br/>
Down the tracks are dark obstructions,<br/>
Trials, troubles, pain and care;<br/>
Hark! He signals “danger!” “danger!”<br/>
Down with brakes! “beware!” “beware!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are sweeping on to glory,<br/>
O’er each culvert, ’round each curve;<br/>
Up the grade of consecration,<br/>
Where our train must never swerve.<br/>
We are speeding o’er the bridges,<br/>
Where a break means certain death;<br/>
O’er the mountains, thro’ the tunnels,<br/>
Where we ride with bated breath.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Soon we’ll reach the heav’nly depot;<br/>
Lo, its spires arise in sight<br/>
As we slow up at the station,<br/>
At our journey’s end alight.<br/>
Oh, the shouts of angels greet us!<br/>
Kindred long gone on before;<br/>
And the Sup’rintendent hails us,<br/>
“Welcome, welcome! evermore!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
