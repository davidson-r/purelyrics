A great and mighty wonder, a full and holy cure:<br/>
The virgin bears the Infant with virgin honor pure!<br/>
Repeat the hymn again: “To God on high be glory<br/>
And peace on earth to men!”<br/>
<br/>
The Word becomes incarnate and yet remains on high,<br/>
And cherubim sing anthems to shepherds from the sky.<br/>
Repeat the hymn again: “To God on high be glory<br/>
And peace on earth to men!”<br/>
<br/>
While thus they sing your Monarch, those bright angelic bands,<br/>
Rejoice, ye vales and mountains, ye oceans, clap your hands.<br/>
Repeat the hymn again: “To God on high be glory<br/>
And peace on earth to men!”<br/>
<br/>
Since all He comes to ransom, by all be He adored,<br/>
The Infant born in Bethl’em, the Savior and the Lord.<br/>
Repeat the hymn again: “To God on high be glory<br/>
And peace on earth to men!”<br/>
<br/>
And idol forms shall perish, and error shall decay,<br/>
And Christ shall wield His scepter, our Lord and God for aye.<br/>
Repeat the hymn again: “To God on high be glory<br/>
And peace on earth to men!”
