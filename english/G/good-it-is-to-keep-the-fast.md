title: Good It Is To Keep The Fast

<br/>
Good it is to keep the fast,<br/>
Shadowed forth in ages past,<br/>
Which our own Almighty Lord<br/>
Hallowed by His deed and Word.<br/>
<br/>
Moses, while he fasted, saw<br/>
God Who gave by him the law;<br/>
To Elijah angels came,<br/>
Steeds of fire and car of flame.<br/>
<br/>
So was Daniel meet to gaze<br/>
On the sight of latter days<br/>
And the Baptist to proclaim<br/>
Blessings through the Bridegroomâ€™s Name.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us, Lord, like them to be<br/>
Oft in prayer and fast with Thee;<br/>
Fill us with Thy heavenly might,<br/>
Be our Joy and true Delight.<br/>
<br/>
Father, hear us through Thy Son,<br/>
And the Spirit, with Thee One,<br/>
Whom our thankful hearts adore,<br/>
Ever and forevermore.<br/>
