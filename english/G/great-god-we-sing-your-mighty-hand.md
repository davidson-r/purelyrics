title: Great God We Sing Your Mighty Hand

<center>
Great God, we sing Your mighty hand<br/>
By which supported still we stand;<br/>
The opening year Your mercy shows,<br/>
That mercy crowns it â€™til its close.<br/>
<br/>
By day, by night, at home, abroad,<br/>
Still are we guarded by our God,<br/>
By His incessant bounty fed,<br/>
By His unerring counsel led.<br/>
<br/>
With grateful hearts the past we own;<br/>
The future, all to us unknown,<br/>
We to Thy guardian care commit,<br/>
And peaceful leave before Thy feet.<br/>
<br/>
In scenes exalted or depressed,<br/>
You are our joy, and You our rest;<br/>
Your goodness all our hopes shall raise,<br/>
Adored through all our changing days.<br/>
<br/>
When death shall interrupt our songs<br/>
And seal in silence mortal tongues,<br/>
In fairer realms, O God, shall we<br/>
Your praises sing eternally.
</center>
