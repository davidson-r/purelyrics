title: Give Heed My Heart

<br/>
Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!<br/>
What is it in that manger lies?<br/>
Who is the Child so young and fair?<br/>
The blessèd Christ Child lieth there.<br/>
<br/>
My heart for very joy doth leap,<br/>
My lips no more can silence keep;<br/>
I, too, must sing, with joyful tongue,<br/>
That sweetest, dearest cradle song.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God in highest heav’n,<br/>
Who unto man His Son has giv’n,<br/>
While angels sing, our hearts to cheer,<br/>
To all the earth a glad new year!<br/>
