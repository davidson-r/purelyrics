title: Grave Itself A Garden Is

<br/>
The grave itself a garden is,<br/>
Where loveliest flowers abound;<br/>
Since Christ, our never fading Life,<br/>
Sprang from that holy ground.<br/>
<br/>
O give us grace to die to sin,<br/>
That we, O Lord, may have<br/>
So holy, happy rest in Thee,<br/>
A Sabbath in the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Lord, baptized in Thine own blood,<br/>
And buried in the grave,<br/>
Didst raise Thyself to endless life,<br/>
Omnipotent to save.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized into Thy death we died,<br/>
And buried were with Thee,<br/>
That we might fly with Thee to God,<br/>
And ever blest might be.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, through the grave and gate of death<br/>
May we, with Thee, arise<br/>
To an eternal Easter day<br/>
Of glory in the skies!<br/>
