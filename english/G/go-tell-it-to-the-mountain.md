title: Go tell it to the Mountain

<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Over the hills and everywhere,<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Our Jesus Christ is born.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a seeker<br/>
I sought both night and day,<br/>
I asked the Lord to help me,<br/>
And he showed me the way. <br/>
<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Over the hills and everywhere,<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Our Jesus Christ is born. <br/>
<br/>
He made me a watchman<br/>
Upon a city wall,<br/>
And if I am a Christian,<br/>
I am the least of all. <br/>
<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Over the hills and everywhere,<br/>
Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>
Our Jesus Christ is born.<br/>
