<br/>
Give thanks to God the Lord; upon His Name now call.<br/>
Make known among the people on earth what He has done for all.<br/>
Sing praise to Him, now sing; His wondrous acts proclaim.<br/>
Rejoice, all you who seek the Lord; come glory in His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Look to the Lord’s great strength; remember all His deeds.<br/>
His judgments are in all of the earth; He is the Lord indeed.<br/>
His cov’nant e’er will stand; His oath He’ll ne’er forget.<br/>
A thousand generations pass; God’s word continues yet.<br/>
<br/>
Sing to the Lord, all earth; His saving power proclaim.<br/>
Declare His glory to every race; His marvelous deeds now name.<br/>
For great is God the Lord, most worthy of all praise.<br/>
He made the heavens and the earth; fear Him and give Him praise.<br/>
<br/>
Splendor and majesty before the Lord are found.<br/>
Both strength and joy with Him do dwell; bring offerings, come bow down.<br/>
Ascribe unto the Lord the glory due His Name;<br/>
The splendor of His holiness now worship and proclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Let now the heav’ns rejoice; let earth give glad refrain.<br/>
The world is ’stablished, ne’er to be moved; tell everyone God reigns!<br/>
Now let the sea resound, be jubilant all fields;<br/>
The forest trees will sing for joy; earth’s Judge is now revealed.<br/>
<br/>
Give thanks to God the Lord; His goodness now declare.<br/>
He saves, delivers from every foe; His love endures fore’er.<br/>
Give thanks unto His Name and glory in His praise;<br/>
Praise to the God of Israel for everlasting days.<br/>
