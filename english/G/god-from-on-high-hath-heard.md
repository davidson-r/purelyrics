God from on high hath heard;<br/>
Let sighs and sorrows cease;<br/>
Lo! from the opening Heav’n descends<br/>
To man the promised Peace.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! through the silent night<br/>
Angelic voices swell;<br/>
Their joyful songs proclaim that “God<br/>
Is born on earth to dwell.”<br/>
<br/>
See how the shepherd band<br/>
Speed on with eager feet;<br/>
Come to the hallowed cave with them<br/>
The Holy Babe to greet.<br/>
<br/>
But, oh, what sight appears<br/>
Within that lowly door!<br/>
A manger, stall, and swaddling clothes,<br/>
A Child and mother poor!<br/>
<br/>
Art Thou the Christ? the Son?<br/>
The Father’s image bright?<br/>
And see we Him Whose arm upholds<br/>
Earth and the starry height?<br/>
<br/>
Yea, faith can pierce the cloud<br/>
Which veils Thy glory now;<br/>
We hail Thee, God, before Whose throne<br/>
The angels prostrate bow.<br/>
<br/>
A silent Teacher, Lord,<br/>
Thou bidd’st us not refuse<br/>
To bear what flesh would have us shun,<br/>
To shun what flesh would choose.<br/>
<br/>
Our sinful pride to cure<br/>
With that pure love of Thine,<br/>
O be Thou born within our hearts,<br/>
Most Holy Child divine.
