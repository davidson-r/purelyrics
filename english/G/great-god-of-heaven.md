title: Great God of Heaven

<center>
The great God of Heaven is come down to earth,<br/>
His mother a virgin, and sinless His birth;<br/>
The Father eternal His Father alone:<br/>
He sleeps in the manger; He reigns on the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then let us adore Him, and praise His great love:<br/>
To save us poor sinners He came from above.<br/>
<br/>
A Babe on the breast of a maiden He lies,<br/>
Yet sits with the Father on high in the skies;<br/>
Before Him their faces the seraphim hide,<br/>
While Joseph stands waiting, unscared, by His side.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lo! here is Emmanuel, here is the Child,<br/>
The Son that was promised to Mary so mild;<br/>
Whose power and dominion shall ever increase,<br/>
The Prince that shall rule o’er a kingdom of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Wonderful Counselor, boundless in might,<br/>
The Father’s own image, the beam of His light;<br/>
Behold Him now wearing the likeness of man,<br/>
Weak, helpless, and speechless, in measure a span.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O wonder of wonders, which none can unfold:<br/>
The Ancient of Days is an hour or two old;<br/>
The Maker of all things is made of the earth,<br/>
Man is worshipped by angels, and God comes to birth:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The word in the bliss of the Godhead remains,<br/>
Yet in flesh comes to suffer the keenest of pains;<br/>
He is that He was, and forever shall be,<br/>
But becomes that He was not, for you and for me.<br/>
<br/>
