Glorious things of thee are spoken,<br/>
Zion, city of our God!<br/>
He, Whose Word cannot be broken,<br/>
Formed thee for His own abode.<br/>
On the Rock of Ages founded,<br/>
What can shake thy sure repose?<br/>
With salvation’s walls surrounded,<br/>
Thou may’st smile at all thy foes.<br/>
<br/>
See! the streams of living waters,<br/>
Springing from eternal love;<br/>
Well supply thy sons and daughters,<br/>
And all fear of want remove:<br/>
Who can faint while such a river<br/>
Ever flows their thirst t’assuage?<br/>
Grace, which like the Lord, the Giver,<br/>
Never fails from age to age.<br/>
<br/>
Round each habitation hovering,<br/>
See the cloud and fire appear!<br/>
For a glory and a cov’ring<br/>
Showing that the Lord is near.<br/>
Thus deriving from our banner<br/>
Light by night and shade by day;<br/>
Safe they feed upon the manna<br/>
Which He gives them when they pray.<br/>
<br/>
Blest inhabitants of Zion,<br/>
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood!<br/>
Jesus, Whom their souls rely on,<br/>
Makes them kings and priests to God.<br/>
’Tis His love His people raises,<br/>
Over self to reign as kings,<br/>
And as priests, His solemn praises<br/>
Each for a thank offering brings.<br/>
<br/>
Savior, if of Zion’s city,<br/>
I through grace a member am,<br/>
Let the world deride or pity,<br/>
I will glory in Thy Name.<br/>
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,<br/>
All his boasted pomp and show;<br/>
Solid joys and lasting treasure<br/>
None but Zion’s children know.
