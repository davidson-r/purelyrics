title: Gentle Shepherd Thou Hast Stilled

<center>
Gentle Shepherd, Thou hast stilled<br/>
Now Thy little lamb’s brief weeping;<br/>
Ah, how peaceful, pale and mild,<br/>
In its narrow bed ’tis sleeping,<br/>
And no sigh of anguish sore<br/>
Heaves that little bosom more.<br/>
<br/>
In this world of care and pain,<br/>
Lord, Thou wouldst no longer leave it;<br/>
To the sunny, heavenly plain<br/>
Thou dost now with joy receive it;<br/>
Clothed in robes of spotless white,<br/>
Now it dwells with Thee in light.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Lord Jesus, grant that we<br/>
Where it lives may soon be living,<br/>
And the lovely pastures see<br/>
That its heavenly food are giving;<br/>
Then the gain of death we prove,<br/>
Though Thou take what most we love.
</center>
