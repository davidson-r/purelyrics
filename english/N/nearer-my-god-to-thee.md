<center>
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!<br/>
E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me,<br/>
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Nearer, my God, to Thee,<br/>
Nearer to Thee!<br/>
<br/>
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,<br/>
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone.<br/>
Yet in my dreams I’d be nearer, my God to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There let the way appear, steps unto Heav’n;<br/>
All that Thou sendest me, in mercy given;<br/>
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,<br/>
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I’ll raise;<br/>
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,<br/>
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I’ll fly,<br/>
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest,<br/>
There in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest;<br/>
Age after age to be, nearer my God to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
