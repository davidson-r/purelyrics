Now praise we great and famous men,<br/>
The fathers named in story;<br/>
And praise the Lord, Who now as then<br/>
Reveals in man His glory.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we the wise and brave and strong,<br/>
Who graced their generation,<br/>
Who helped the right, and fought the wrong,<br/>
And made our folk a nation.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we the great of heart and mind,<br/>
The singers sweetly gifted,<br/>
Whose music like a mighty wind<br/>
The souls of men uplifted.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we the peaceful men of skill,<br/>
Who builded homes of beauty,<br/>
And, rich in art, made richer still<br/>
The brotherhood of duty.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we the glorious names we know,<br/>
And they whose names have perished,<br/>
Lost, in the haze of long ago,<br/>
In silent love be cherished.<br/>
<br/>
In peace their sacred ashes rest,<br/>
Fulfilled their dayâ€™s endeavor;<br/>
They blessed the earth, and they are blessed<br/>
Of God and man forever.
