<br/>
Now praise we Christ, the Holy One,<br/>
The blessed virgin Mary’s Son,<br/>
Far as the glorious sun doth shine,<br/>
E’en to the world’s remote confine.<br/>
<br/>
He Who Himself all things did make<br/>
A servant’s form vouchsafed to take<br/>
That He as man mankind might win<br/>
And save His creatures from their sin.<br/>
<br/>
The grace and power of God the Lord<br/>
Upon the mother was outpoured;<br/>
A virgin pure and undefiled<br/>
In wondrous wise conceived a Child.<br/>
<br/>
The noble mother bore a Son<br/>
For so did Gabriel’s promise run<br/>
Whom John confessed and leaped with joy<br/>
Ere yet the mother knew her Boy.<br/>
<br/>
Upon a manger filled with hay<br/>
In poverty content He lay;<br/>
With milk was fed the Lord of all,<br/>
Who feeds the ravens when they call.<br/>
<br/>
The heavenly choirs rejoice and raise<br/>
Their voice to God in songs of praise.<br/>
To humble shepherds is proclaimed<br/>
The Shepherd Who the world hath framed.<br/>
<br/>
All honor unto Christ be paid,<br/>
Pure Offspring of the favored maid,<br/>
With Father and with Holy Ghost,<br/>
Till time in endless time be lost.<br/>
