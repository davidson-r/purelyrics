title: Not by Thy Mighty Hand

<br/>
Not by Thy mighty hand,<br/>
Thy wondrous works alone,<br/>
But by the marvels of Thy Word,<br/>
Thy glory, Lord, is known.<br/>
<br/>
Forth from the eternal gates,<br/>
Thine everlasting home,<br/>
To sow the seed of truth alone,<br/>
Thou didst vouchsafe to come.<br/>
<br/>
And still from age to age,<br/>
Thou, gracious Lord, hast been<br/>
The Bearer forth of goodly seed,<br/>
The Sower still unseen.<br/>
<br/>
And Thou wilt come again,<br/>
And Heavâ€™n beneath Thee bow,<br/>
To reap the harvest Thou hast sown,<br/>
Sower and Reaper Thou.<br/>
<br/>
Watch, Lord, Thy harvest field,<br/>
With Thine unsleeping eye,<br/>
The children of the kingdom keep<br/>
To Thy epiphany!<br/>
<br/>
That, when in Thy great day<br/>
The tares shall severed be,<br/>
We may be surely gathered in<br/>
With all Thy saints to Thee.<br/>
