<br/>
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,<br/>
Nor riches of earth could have saved my poor soul;<br/>
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,<br/>
The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I am redeemed, but not with silver,<br/>
I am bought, but not with gold;<br/>
Bought with a price, the blood of Jesus,<br/>
Precious price of love untold.<br/>
<br/>
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,<br/>
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown;<br/>
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,<br/>
The death of my Savior could only atone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,<br/>
The holy commandment forbade me draw near;<br/>
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,<br/>
The death of my Savior removeth my fear.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,<br/>
The way into Heaven could not thus be bought;<br/>
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,<br/>
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
