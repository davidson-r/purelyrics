<br/>
“Nearer the cross!” my heart can say<br/>
I am coming nearer,<br/>
Nearer the cross from day to day,<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
Nearer the cross where Jesus died,<br/>
Nearer the fountain’s crimson tide,<br/>
Nearer my Savior’s wounded side,<br/>
I am coming nearer, I am coming nearer.<br/>
<br/>
Nearer the Christian’s mercy seat,<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
Feasting my soul on manna sweet<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
Stronger in faith, more clear I see<br/>
Jesus Who gave Himself for me;<br/>
Nearer to Him I still would be,<br/>
Still I’m coming nearer<br/>
Still I’m coming nearer.<br/>
<br/>
Nearer in prayer my hope aspires,<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
Deeper the love my soul desires,<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
Nearer the end of toil and care,<br/>
Nearer the joy I long to share,<br/>
Nearer the crown I soon shall wear;<br/>
I am coming nearer;<br/>
I am coming nearer.<br/>
