title: New Every Morning Is The Love

<br/>
New every morning is the love<br/>
Our wakening and uprising prove;<br/>
Through sleep and darkness safely brought,<br/>
Restored to life and power and thought.<br/>
<br/>
New mercies, each returning day,<br/>
Hover around us while we pray;<br/>
New perils past, new sins forgiven,<br/>
New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
If, on our daily course, our mind<br/>
Be set to hallow all we find,<br/>
New treasures still, of countless price,<br/>
God will provide for sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,<br/>
As more of heaven in each we see;<br/>
Some softening gleam of love and prayer<br/>
Shall dawn on every cross and care.<br/>
<br/>
We need not bid, for cloistered cell,<br/>
Our neighbor and our words farewell,<br/>
Nor strive to find ourselves too high<br/>
For sinful man beneath the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The trivial round, the common task,<br/>
Will furnish all we ought to ask;<br/>
Room to deny ourselves, a road<br/>
To bring us daily nearer God.<br/>
<br/>
Seek we no more; content with these,<br/>
Let present rapture, comfort, ease<br/>
As heaven shall bid them, come and go:<br/>
The secret this of rest below.<br/>
<br/>
Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love,<br/>
Fit us for perfect rest above,<br/>
And help us, this and every day,<br/>
To live more nearly as we pray.<br/>
