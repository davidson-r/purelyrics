title: Now With Creations Morning Song

<center>
Now with creationâ€™s morning song<br/>
Let us, as children of the day,<br/>
With wakened heart and purpose strong,<br/>
The works of darkness cast away.<br/>
<br/>
O may the morn so pure, so clear,<br/>
Its own sweet calm in us instill!<br/>
A guileless mind, a heart sincere,<br/>
Simplicity of word and will.<br/>
<br/>
And ever, as the day glides by,<br/>
May we the busy senses rein;<br/>
Keep guard upon the hand and eye,<br/>
Nor let the conscience suffer stain.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us, O God, in love to Thee,<br/>
Clear eyes to measure things below;<br/>
Faith, the invisible to see;<br/>
And wisdom, Thee in all to know.
