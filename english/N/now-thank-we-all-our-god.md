<center>
Now thank we all our God,<br/>
With heart and hands and voices,<br/>
Who wondrous things hath done,<br/>
In whom his world rejoices;<br/>
Who from our mother's arms<br/>
Hath blessed us on our way<br/>
With countless gifts of love,<br/>
And still is ours to-day.<br/>
<br/>
O may this bounteous God<br/>
Through all our life be near us,<br/>
With ever joyful hearts<br/>
And blessed peace to cheer us;<br/>
And keep us in his grace,<br/>
And guide us when perplexed,<br/>
And free us from all ills<br/>
In this world and the next.<br/>
<br/>
All praise and thanks to God<br/>
The Father now be given,<br/>
The son, and him who reigns,<br/>
With them in highest heaven,<br/>
The one eternal God,<br/>
Whom earth and heaven adore;<br/>
For thus it was, is now,<br/>
And shall be evermore.
