<br/>
Not alone for mighty empire, stretching far over land and sea,<br/>
Not alone for bounteous harvests, lift we up our hearts to Thee.<br/>
Standing in the living present, memory and hope between,<br/>
Lord, we would with deep thanksgiving, praise Thee more for things unseen.<br/>
<br/>
Not for battleships and fortress, not for conquests of the sword,<br/>
But for conquests of the spirit give we thanks to Thee, O Lord;<br/>
For the priceless gift of freedom, for the home, the church, the school,<br/>
For the open door to manhood, in a land the people rule.<br/>
<br/>
For the armies of the faithful, souls that passed and left no name;<br/>
For the glory that illumines patriot lives of deathless fame.<br/>
For our prophets and apostles, loyal to the living Word,<br/>
For all heroes of the spirit, give we thanks to Thee, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
God of justice, save the people from the clash of race and creed,<br/>
From the strife of class and faction, make our nation free indeed;<br/>
Keep her faith in simple manhood strong as when her life began,<br/>
Till it find its full fruition in the brotherhood of man!<br/>
