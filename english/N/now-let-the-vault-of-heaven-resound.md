<center>
Now let the vault of Heav’n resound<br/>
In praise of love that doth abound,<br/>
“Christ hath triumphed, alleluia!”<br/>
Sing, choirs of angels, loud and clear,<br/>
Repeat their song of glory here,<br/>
“Christ hath triumphed, Christ hath triumphed!”<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.<br/>
<br/>
Eternal is the gift He brings,<br/>
Wherefore our heart with rapture sings,<br/>
“Christ hath triumphed, Jesus liveth!”<br/>
Now doth He come and give us life,<br/>
Now doth His presence still all strife<br/>
Through His triumph; Jesus reigneth!<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.<br/>
<br/>
O fill us, Lord, with dauntless love;<br/>
Set heart and will on things above<br/>
That we conquer through Thy triumph,<br/>
Grant grace sufficient for life’s day<br/>
That by our life we ever say,<br/>
“Christ hath triumphed, and He liveth!”<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.<br/>
<br/>
Adoring praises now we bring<br/>
And with the heavenly blessèd sing,<br/>
“Christ hath triumphed, Alleluia!”<br/>
Be to the Father, and our Lord,<br/>
To Spirit blest, most holy God,<br/>
Thine the glory, never ending!<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
