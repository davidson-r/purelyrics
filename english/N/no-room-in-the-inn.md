title: No room in the inn

<center>
<br/>
No beautiful chamber, no soft cradle bed,<br/>
No place but a manger, nowhere for His head;<br/>
No praises of gladness, no thought of their sin,<br/>
No glory but sadness, no room in the inn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No room, no room, for Jesus,<br/>
O give Him welcome free,<br/>
Lest you should hear at Heaven’s gate,<br/>
“There is no room for thee.”<br/>
<br/>
No sweet consecration, no seeking His part,<br/>
No humiliation, no place in the heart;<br/>
No thought of the Savior, no sorrow for sin,<br/>
No prayer for His favor, no room in the inn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No one to receive Him, no welcome while here,<br/>
No balm to relieve Him, no staff but a spear;<br/>
No seeking His treasure, no weeping for sin,<br/>
No doing His pleasure, no room in the inn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
