<br/>
Never shone a light so fair,<br/>
Never fell so sweet a song,<br/>
As the chorus in the air<br/>
Chanted by the angel throng;<br/>
Ev’ry star took up the story:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Christ has come, the Prince of glory,<br/>
Come in humble hearts to dwell;<br/>
God with us, God with us,<br/>
God with us, Immanuel!”<br/>
<br/>
Still that Jubilee of song<br/>
Breaks upon the rising morn;<br/>
While the anthem rolls along,<br/>
Floods of light the earth adorn;<br/>
Old and young take up the story:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Welcome now the blessèd day,<br/>
When we praise the Lord our King;<br/>
When we meet to praise and pray,<br/>
And His love with gladness sing;<br/>
Let the world take up the story:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
