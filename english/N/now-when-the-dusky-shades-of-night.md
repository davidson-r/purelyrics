<br/>
Now, when the dusky shades of night, retreating<br/>
Before the sun’s red banner, swiftly flee;<br/>
Now, when the terrors of the dark are fleeting,<br/>
O Lord, we lift our thankful hearts to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee, Whose Word, the fount of light unsealing,<br/>
When hill and dale in thickest darkness lay,<br/>
Awoke bright rays across the dim earth stealing,<br/>
And bade the even and morn complete the day.<br/>
<br/>
Look from the tower of heaven, and send to cheer us,<br/>
Thy light and truth, to guide us onward still;<br/>
Still let Thy mercy, as of old, be near us,<br/>
And lead us safely to Thy holy hill.<br/>
<br/>
In vain to labor, unless Thou be with him,<br/>
Man goeth forth through all the weary day;<br/>
In vain his strife, in vain his toil unceasing,<br/>
Unless Thy staff bring comfort on his way.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Who hast made the north and south, watch o’er us;<br/>
Thou, in Whose Name the lonely ones rejoice,<br/>
Still let Thy cloudy pillar glide before us,<br/>
Still let us listen for Thy warning voice.<br/>
<br/>
So, when the morn of endless light is waking,<br/>
And shades of evil from its splendors flee,<br/>
Safe may we rise, the earth’s dark breast forsaking,<br/>
Through all the long bright day to dwell with Thee.<br/>
