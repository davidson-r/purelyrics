title: None is Like God

<center>
None is like God, Who reigns above,<br/>
So great, so pure, so high;<br/>
None is like God, Whose Name is Love,<br/>
And Who is always nigh.<br/>
<br/>
In all the earth there is no spot<br/>
Excluded from His care;<br/>
We cannot go where God is not,<br/>
For He is everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
He is our best and kindest Friend,<br/>
And guards us night and day;<br/>
To all our wants He will attend,<br/>
And answer when we pray.<br/>
<br/>
O if we love Him as we ought,<br/>
And on His grace rely,<br/>
We shall be joyful at the thought<br/>
That God is always nigh.
