title: Now The Green Blade Rises

<br/>
Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,<br/>
Wheat that in the dark earth many years has lain;<br/>
Love lives again, that with the dead has been:<br/>
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.<br/>
<br/>
In the grave they laid Him, Love Whom we had slain,<br/>
Thinking that Heâ€™d never wake to life again,<br/>
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:<br/>
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.<br/>
<br/>
Up He sprang at Easter, like the risen grain,<br/>
He that for three days in the grave had lain;<br/>
Up from the dead my risen Lord is seen:<br/>
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.<br/>
<br/>
When our hearts are saddened, grieving or in pain,<br/>
By Your touch You call us back to life again;<br/>
Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:<br/>
Love is come again, like wheat that springs up green.<br/>
