<br/>
No, no, it is not dying<br/>
To go unto our God;<br/>
This gloomy earth forsaking,<br/>
Our journey homeward taking<br/>
Along the starry road.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, it is not dying<br/>
Heaven’s citizen to be;<br/>
A crown immortal wearing,<br/>
And rest unbroken sharing,<br/>
From care and conflict free.<br/>
<br/>
No, no it is not dying<br/>
To hear this gracious word,<br/>
“Receive a Father’s blessing,<br/>
Forevermore possessing<br/>
The favor of thy Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
No, no it is not dying<br/>
The Shepherd’s voice to know:<br/>
His sheep He ever leadeth,<br/>
His peaceful flock He feedeth,<br/>
Where living pastures grow.<br/>
<br/>
No, no it is not dying<br/>
To wear a lordly crown;<br/>
Among God’s people dwelling,<br/>
The glorious triumph swelling<br/>
Of Him Whose sway we own.<br/>
