<br/>
Now woods and wolds are sleeping,<br/>
And darkness fast is creeping<br/>
Oâ€™er byre, hearth, and hall;<br/>
But thou, my soul, ere slumber,<br/>
For blessings passing number<br/>
Exalt the Giver of them all.<br/>
<br/>
Ye also, O my dearest,<br/>
My friends and kindred nearest,<br/>
God rest you safe from harm!<br/>
His angel hosts attend ye,<br/>
Their golden shields defend ye,<br/>
From nightly danger and alarm.<br/>
