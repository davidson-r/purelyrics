The newborn King Who comes today<br/>
Brings tidings of great joy,<br/>
Which sin can never take away,<br/>
Nor death nor hell destroy.<br/>
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,<br/>
And hail this glorious dawn,<br/>
For God comes down, frail man to crown:<br/>
The Lord of Life is born!<br/>
<br/>
He comes not as a king of earth,<br/>
In pomp and pride to reign;<br/>
He seeks a poor and humble birth,<br/>
But free from sinful stain;<br/>
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,<br/>
Glad hymns of triumph sing:<br/>
The Wonderful, the Counsellor,<br/>
He comes, your God and King!<br/>
<br/>
For us He leaves His Father’s throne,<br/>
His sapphire throne on high,<br/>
And comes to dwell on earth alone,<br/>
For fallen man to die.<br/>
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,<br/>
All hail Messiah’s dawn:<br/>
Our God comes down, earth’s joy and crown,<br/>
The King of Love is born!<br/>
<br/>
Glad Gentiles in their eastern home<br/>
His radiant star behold;<br/>
To God, their King, they joy to bring<br/>
Sweet incense, myrrh, and gold.<br/>
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice,<br/>
In heaven your praises sing:<br/>
Before Him fall, the Lord of all,<br/>
Your Maker and your King!<br/>
<br/>
We join your song, celestial throng,<br/>
Whose anthems never cease;<br/>
We tune our lyres, with angels choirs,<br/>
To hail the Prince of Peace!<br/>
Rejoice, ye Gentile lands, rejoice<br/>
All hail Immanuel’s morn:<br/>
For God comes down, frail man to crown,<br/>
To us a Child is born.
