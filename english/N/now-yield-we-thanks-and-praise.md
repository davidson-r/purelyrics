<center>
Now yield we thanks and praise to Christ enthroned in glory,<br/>
And on this day of days tell out redemption’s story,<br/>
Who truly have believed that on this blessèd morn,<br/>
In holiness conceived, the Son of God was born.<br/>
<br/>
What tribute shall we pay to Him who came in weakness,<br/>
And in a manger lay to teach His people meekness?<br/>
Let every house be bright; let praises never cease;<br/>
With mercies infinite our Christ hath brought us peace.
