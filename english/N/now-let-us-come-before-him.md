title: Now Let Us Come Before Him

<center>
Now let us come before Him,<br/>
With song and prayer adore Him,<br/>
Who to our life hath given<br/>
All needed strength from Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
The stream of years is flowing,<br/>
And we are onward going,<br/>
From old to new surviving<br/>
And by His mercy thriving.<br/>
<br/>
In woe we often languish<br/>
And pass through times of anguish<br/>
Of wars and trepidation<br/>
Alarming every nation.<br/>
<br/>
As mothers watch are keeping<br/>
O’er children who are sleeping,<br/>
Their fear and grief assuaging<br/>
When angry storms are waging.<br/>
<br/>
So God His own is shielding<br/>
And help to them is yielding.<br/>
When need and woe distress them,<br/>
His loving arms caress them.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou Who dost not slumber,<br/>
Remove what would encumber<br/>
Our work, which prospers never<br/>
Unless Thou bless it ever.<br/>
<br/>
O God of mercy, hear us;<br/>
Our Father, be Thou near us;<br/>
Mid crosses and in sadness<br/>
Be Thou our Fount of gladness.<br/>
<br/>
To all who bow before Thee<br/>
And for Thy grace implore Thee,<br/>
Oh, grant Thy benediction<br/>
And patience in affliction.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou a Helper speedy<br/>
To all the poor and needy,<br/>
To all forlorn a Father;<br/>
Thine erring children gather.<br/>
<br/>
Be with the sick and ailing,<br/>
Their Comforter unfailing;<br/>
Dispelling grief and sadness,<br/>
Oh, give them joy and gladness!<br/>
<br/>
Above all else, Lord, send us<br/>
Thy Spirit to attend us,<br/>
Within our hearts abiding,<br/>
To Heav’n our footsteps guiding.<br/>
<br/>
All this Thy hand bestoweth,<br/>
Thou Life, whence our life floweth.<br/>
To all Thy Name confessing<br/>
Grant, Lord, Thy New Year’s blessing!
