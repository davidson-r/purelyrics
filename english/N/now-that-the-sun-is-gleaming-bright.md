title: Now That The Sun Is Gleaming Bright

<center>
<br/>
Now that the sun is gleaming bright,<br/>
Implore we, bending low,<br/>
That He, the uncreated Light<br/>
May guide us as we go.<br/>
<br/>
No sinful word, nor deed of wrong<br/>
Nor thoughts that idly rove,<br/>
But simple truth be on our tongue,<br/>
And in our hearts be love.<br/>
<br/>
And while the hours in order flow,<br/>
O Christ, securely fence<br/>
Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,<br/>
The gate of every sense.<br/>
<br/>
And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,<br/>
Our daily toil may tend;<br/>
That we begin it at Thy Word,<br/>
And in Thy favor end.<br/>
