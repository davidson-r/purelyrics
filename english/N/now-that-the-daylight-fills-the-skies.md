title: Now That The Daylight Fills The Skies

<center>
Now that the daylight fills the sky,<br/>
We lift our hearts to God on high,<br/>
That He, in all we do or say,<br/>
Would keep us free from harm today.<br/>
<br/>
May He restrain our tongues from strife,<br/>
And shield from anger’s din our life,<br/>
And guard with watchful care our eyes<br/>
From earth’s absorbing vanities.<br/>
<br/>
O may our inmost hearts be pure,<br/>
From thoughts of folly kept secure,<br/>
And pride of sinful flesh subdued<br/>
Through sparing use of daily food.<br/>
<br/>
So we, when this day’s work is o’er,<br/>
And shades of night return once more,<br/>
Our path of trial safely trod,<br/>
Shall give the glory to our God.<br/>
<br/>
All praise to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,<br/>
Whom with the Spirit we adore<br/>
Forever and forevermore.
