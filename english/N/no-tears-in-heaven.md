title: No Tears In Heaven

<center>
Our youth is transient like a flower,<br/>
That blooms, and fades, and dies;<br/>
Our life is but a summer cloud,<br/>
And like a shadow flies;<br/>
Then let us heed the warning voice—<br/>
Today its call we hear,<br/>
It speaks in deep and solemn tones,<br/>
That come from yonder bier.<br/>
<br/>
The angel messenger of death,<br/>
Has gently borne away,<br/>
A dear companion from our side,<br/>
To realms of endless day;<br/>
Her voice no more will join with ours<br/>
The song of praise below,<br/>
It wakes a purer, sweeter strain,<br/>
Where only pleasures flow.<br/>
<br/>
When gathered on the Sabbath morn,<br/>
Her vacant place we view,<br/>
We’ll think how bright the world she treads,<br/>
And in her steps pursue;<br/>
Be still, let every heart be still,<br/>
And all our sorrow quell,<br/>
We’ll bow submissive to His will,<br/>
Who doeth all things well.
