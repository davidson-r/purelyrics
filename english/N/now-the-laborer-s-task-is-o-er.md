title: Now The Laborers Task Is Oer

<br/>
Now the laborer’s task is o’er;<br/>
Now the battle day is past;<br/>
Now upon the farther shore<br/>
Lands the voyager at last.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Father, in Thy gracious keeping<br/>
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
There the tears of earth are dried;<br/>
There its hidden things are clear;<br/>
There the work of life is tried<br/>
By a juster Judge than here.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There the Shepherd, bringing home<br/>
Many a lamb forlorn and strayed,<br/>
Shelters each, no more to roam,<br/>
Where the wolf can ne’er invade.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There the sinful souls, that turn<br/>
To the cross their dying eyes,<br/>
All the love of Christ shall learn<br/>
At His feet in Paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There no more the powers of hell<br/>
Can prevail to mar their peace;<br/>
Christ the Lord shall guard them well,<br/>
He Who died for their release.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Earth to earth, and dust to dust,”<br/>
Calmly now the words we say;<br/>
Left behind, we wait in trust<br/>
For the resurrection day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
