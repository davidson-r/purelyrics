<br/>
Nations that long in darkness walked<br/>
Have now beheld a glorious light;<br/>
On them who dwelt in shades of death<br/>
The light hath shinèd heav’nly bright.<br/>
<br/>
For lo! the virgin’s Child is born;<br/>
To us the Son of God is giv’n.<br/>
Upon His shoulders shall be laid<br/>
The government of earth and Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
His Name is callèd Wonderful,<br/>
The Counselor, the mighty God,<br/>
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace,<br/>
Peace dearly purchased with His blood.<br/>
<br/>
His government shall know no bounds,<br/>
But far and wide o’er all extend;<br/>
And happy peace, the glorious fruits<br/>
Of His just reign, shall know no end.<br/>
<br/>
O’er David’s kingdom, on His throne<br/>
To rule, and ’stablish it secure<br/>
With judgment clear, and justice right;<br/>
His reign forever shall endure.<br/>
