<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled,<br/>
God’s Son is manifested,<br/>
Now His great majesty<br/>
In human flesh is vested.<br/>
Behold the mighty God,<br/>
By Whom all wrath is stilled,<br/>
The woman’s promised Seed—<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled,<br/>
Lo, Jacob’s Star is shining;<br/>
The gloomy night has fled<br/>
Wherein the world lay pining.<br/>
Now, Israel, look on Him<br/>
Who long thy heart hath thrilled;<br/>
Hear Zion’s watchmen cry:<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled,<br/>
The child of God rejoices;<br/>
No bondage of the Law,<br/>
No curses that it voices,<br/>
Can fill our hearts with fear;<br/>
On Christ our hope we build.<br/>
Behold the Prince of Peace<br/>
Now are the days fulfilled.<br/>
