title: Now Is The Healing Time Decreed

Now is the healing time decreed<br/>
For sins of heart, of word or deed,<br/>
When we in humble fear record<br/>
The wrong that we have done the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Who, always merciful and good,<br/>
Has borne so long our wayward mood,<br/>
Nor cut us off unsparingly<br/>
In our so great iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore with fasting and with prayer,<br/>
Our secret sorrow we declare;<br/>
With all good striving seek His face,<br/>
And lowly hearted plead for grace.<br/>
<br/>
Cleanse us, O Lord, from every stain,<br/>
Help us the meed of praise to gain,<br/>
Till with the angels linked in love<br/>
Joyful we tread Thy courts above.<br/>
<br/>
Father and Son and Spirit blest,<br/>
To Thee be every prayer addrest,<br/>
Who art in threefold Name adored,<br/>
From age to age, the only Lord.
