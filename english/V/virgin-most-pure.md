title: Virgin most Pure

<center>
A virgin most pure, as the prophets do tell,<br/>
Hath brought forth a Baby, as it hath befell,<br/>
To be our Redeemer from death, hell and sin,<br/>
Which Adam’s transgression has wrappèd us in.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And therefore be merry, set sorrow aside;<br/>
Christ Jesus our Savior was born on this tide.<br/>
<br/>
At Bethlehem city, in Jewry it was<br/>
Where Joseph and Mary together did pass,<br/>
And there to be taxed, with many one more,<br/>
For Cæsar commanded the same should be so.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
But, when they had entered the city so fair<br/>
A number of people so mighty was there,<br/>
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,<br/>
Could get in the city no lodging at all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then were they constrained in a stable to lie,<br/>
Where oxen and asses they used to tie;<br/>
Their lodging so simple, they held it no scorn,<br/>
But against the next morning our Savior was born.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The King of all glory to this world being brought,<br/>
Small store of fine linen to wrap Him was sought,<br/>
When Mary had swaddled her young Son so sweet,<br/>
Within an ox manger she laid Him to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high,<br/>
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,<br/>
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,<br/>
Because that our Savior was born on this day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then presently after, the shepherds did spy<br/>
A number of angels appear in the sky;<br/>
Who joyfully talkèd and sweetly did sing,<br/>
To God be all glory, our heavenly King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Three certain wise princes, they thought it most meet<br/>
To lay their rich offerings at our Savior’s feet;<br/>
Then the Shepherds consented, and to Bethlehem did go,<br/>
And when they came thither, they found it was so.<br/>
<br/>
