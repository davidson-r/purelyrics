<br/>
Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!<br/>
From condemnation He hath made me free;<br/>
“He that believeth on the Son,” said He,<br/>
“Hath everlasting life.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Verily, verily, I say unto you;<br/>
Verily, verily,” message ever new!<br/>
“He that believeth on the Son” ’tis true!<br/>
“Hath everlasting life!”<br/>
<br/>
All my iniquities on Him were laid,<br/>
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;<br/>
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,<br/>
“Hath everlasting life.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;<br/>
Though weak and sinful I believe His Word;<br/>
O glad message! Every child of God<br/>
“Hath everlasting life.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt;<br/>
For him that cometh He will not cast out:<br/>
“He that believeth,” oh, the good news shout!<br/>
“Hath everlasting life.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
