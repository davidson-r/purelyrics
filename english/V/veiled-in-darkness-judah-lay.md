<br/>
Veiled in darkness Judah lay,<br/>
Waiting for the promised day,<br/>
While across the shadowy night<br/>
Streamed a flood of glorious light,<br/>
Heav’nly voices chanting then,<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
<br/>
Still the earth in darkness lies.<br/>
Up from death’s dark vale arise<br/>
Voices of a world in grief,<br/>
Prayers of men who seek relief:<br/>
Now our darkness pierce again,<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
<br/>
Light of light, we humbly pray,<br/>
Shine upon Thy world today;<br/>
Break the gloom of our dark night,<br/>
Fill our souls with love and light,<br/>
Send Thy blessèd Word again,<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
