<br/>
When the hosts of Israel led by God,<br/>
Round the walls of Jericho softly trod,<br/>
Trusting in the Lord,<br/>
They felt the conqueror’s tread,<br/>
By faith they saw the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Victory ahead, victory ahead,<br/>
Through the blood of Jesus, victory ahead.<br/>
Trusting in the Lord, I hear the conqueror’s tread,<br/>
By faith I see the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
David with a shepherd’s sling and five stones,<br/>
Met the giant on the field all alone,<br/>
Trusting in the Lord, he knew what God had said,<br/>
By faith he saw the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Daniel prayed unto the Lord thrice each day,<br/>
Then unto the lion’s den led the way,<br/>
Trusting in the Lord, he did not fear or dread,<br/>
By faith he saw the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Often with the carnal mind I was tried,<br/>
Asking for deliverance oft I cried,<br/>
Trusting in the Lord, I reckoned I was dead,<br/>
By faith I see the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When like those who’ve gone before to that land,<br/>
By death’s river cold and dark I shall stand.<br/>
Trusting in the Lord, I will not fear or dread,<br/>
By faith I see the victory ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
