title: Voice That Breathed Oer Eden

<br/>
The voice that breathed o’er Eden, that earliest wedding day,<br/>
The primal wedding blessing, it hath not passed away.<br/>
Still in the pure espousal of Christian man and maid<br/>
The Holy Three are with us, the threefold grace is said.<br/>
<br/>
For dower of blessèd children,<br/>
For love and faith’s sweet sake,<br/>
For high mysterious union<br/>
Which naught on earth may break.<br/>
<br/>
Be present, awful Father, to give away this bride<br/>
As Thou gav’st Eve to Adam, a helpmate at his side.<br/>
Be present, Son of Mary, to join their loving hands<br/>
As Thou didst bind two natures in Thine eternal bands.<br/>
<br/>
Be present, Holy Spirit, to bless them as they kneel,<br/>
As Thou for Christ, the Bridegroom, the heav’nly Spouse dost seal.<br/>
O spread Thy pure wing o’er them, let no ill power find place<br/>
When onward to Thine altar their hallowed path they trace.<br/>
<br/>
To cast their crowns before Thee in perfect sacrifice,<br/>
Till to the home of gladness with Christ’s own Bride they rise.<br/>
To Father, Son, and Spirit, eternal One and Three,<br/>
And was and is forever, all praise and glory be.<br/>
