<br/>
Valley lilies, meek and lowly,<br/>
Let me hear your message sweet,<br/>
Tell of Christ the pure and holy,<br/>
Bending as to touch His feet.<br/>
<br/>
Snowy lilies of the valley,<br/>
Speak again your message rare;<br/>
Testify to me of Jesus,<br/>
Heaven’s Lily, wondrous fair!<br/>
<br/>
Valley lilies, golden hearted,<br/>
Love’s sweet mission you fulfill,<br/>
For you tell in perfumed language,<br/>
How He wrought His Father’s will.<br/>
<br/>
Valley lilies, cups inverted,<br/>
Still the Master you proclaim:<br/>
Empty of all pomp and glory,<br/>
To redeem the world He came.<br/>
