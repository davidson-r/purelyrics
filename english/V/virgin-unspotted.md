<br/>
A virgin unspotted, the prophet foretold,<br/>
Should bring forth a Savior, which now we behold,<br/>
To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,<br/>
Which Adam’s transgression had wrappèd us in.<br/>
<br/>
Aye and therefore be merry, set sorrow aside,<br/>
Christ Jesus our Savior was born on this tide.<br/>
<br/>
At Bethlehem city in Jewry it was<br/>
That Joseph and Mary together did pass,<br/>
All for to be taxèd with many one moe [sic],<br/>
Great Caesar commanded the same should be so.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
But when they had entered the city so fair,<br/>
A number of people so mighty was there,<br/>
That Joseph and Mary, whose substance was small,<br/>
Could find in the inn there no lodging at all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then were they constrained in a stable to lie,<br/>
Where horses and asses they used for to tie;<br/>
Their lodging so simple they took it no scorn,<br/>
But against the next morning our Savior was born.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The King of all kings to this world being brought,<br/>
Small store of fine linen to wrap Him was sought,<br/>
But when she had swaddled her young Son so sweet,<br/>
Within an ox manger she laid Him to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then God sent an angel from Heaven so high,<br/>
To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lie,<br/>
And bade them no longer in sorrow to stay,<br/>
Because that our Savior was born on this day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then presently after the shepherds did spy<br/>
Vast numbers of angels to stand in the sky;<br/>
They joyfully talkèd and sweetly did sing,<br/>
To God be all glory, our heavenly King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
To teach us humility all this was done,<br/>
And learn we from thence haughty pride for to shun:<br/>
A manger His cradle Who came from above,<br/>
The great God of mercy, of peace and of love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
