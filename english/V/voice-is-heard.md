<br/>
A voice is heard in the dewy dawn,<br/>
And the call is sweet and low;<br/>
Come now, my child to the Shepherd’s fold,<br/>
Where the living waters flow;<br/>
But the gay heart answers in careless tones,<br/>
As light as the morning chime,<br/>
“Let me live for the world just a little while,<br/>
I will come to God—sometime!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beware! Beware! At the pearly gate<br/>
God may answer your sometime, too late! too late!<br/>
Beware! Beware! At the pearly gate<br/>
God may answer your sometime, too late! too late!<br/>
<br/>
The day is nearing the noontide glow,<br/>
And the voice is heard again,<br/>
It calls the soul to a nobler life,<br/>
’Tis a patient, kind refrain;<br/>
Enter now the Master’s broad harvest field,<br/>
In the strength of your early prime,<br/>
Come and bring to His work service good and true,<br/>
Still the same reply—“sometime!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The feet are treading the western slope,<br/>
And the air is growing chill;<br/>
O can it be God is waiting yet,<br/>
That His voice is pleading still?<br/>
That He’ll flood with beauty the sunset sky,<br/>
Bright rays from the Golden Clime?<br/>
But the sinner long hardened, has turned away,<br/>
With the fatal word—“sometime!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O soul, take heed, ere the shadows fall,<br/>
And the day of grace be past,<br/>
For how shall a trembling sinner stand<br/>
By the gates of death at last?<br/>
Hear the Savior’s call; at the Cross lay down<br/>
Thy burden of guilt and crime,<br/>
And the angels shall sing thee a sweeter song<br/>
Than the sad refrain “Sometime.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
