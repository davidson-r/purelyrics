Victorious! Victorious!<br/>
Christ has arisen glorious;<br/>
Where the fun’ral knell was tolled<br/>
Be the hymn of triumph rolled,<br/>
Let the palm’s green branches wave<br/>
O’er the slumber of the grave;<br/>
From its gloom victorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious.<br/>
<br/>
Victorious! Victorious!<br/>
Christ has arisen glorious;<br/>
Where the heavy tomb was sealed<br/>
Gates of Paradise revealed,<br/>
Where the mourners wept around,<br/>
Faith looks up, with glory crowned.<br/>
O’er the grave, victorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious.<br/>
<br/>
Victorious! Victorious!<br/>
Christ has arisen glorious;<br/>
On His brow the conqueror’s wreath,<br/>
In His hand the keys of death,<br/>
He shall buried hopes restore,<br/>
He shall live forevermore.<br/>
Over death victorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious,<br/>
Christ has risen glorious.
