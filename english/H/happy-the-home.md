<br/>
Happy the home when God is there,<br/>
And love fills every breast;<br/>
When one their wish, and one their prayer,<br/>
And one their heav’nly rest.<br/>
<br/>
Happy the home where Jesus’ Name<br/>
Is sweet to every ear;<br/>
Where children early speak His fame,<br/>
And parents hold Him dear.<br/>
<br/>
Happy the home where prayer is heard,<br/>
And praise each day does rise;<br/>
Where parents love the sacred Word<br/>
And all its wisdom prize.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, let us in our homes agree<br/>
This blessèd peace to gain;<br/>
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,<br/>
And love to all will reign. <br/>
