<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!<br/>
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!<br/>
God in three Persons, blessèd Trinity!<br/>
<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,<br/>
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;<br/>
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,<br/>
Who was, and is, and evermore shall be.<br/>
<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,<br/>
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;<br/>
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,<br/>
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.<br/>
<br/>
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!<br/>
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea;<br/>
Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!<br/>
God in three Persons, blessèd Trinity!<br/>
