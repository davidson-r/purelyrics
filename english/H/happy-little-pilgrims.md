<br/>
Happy little pilgrims,<br/>
We should neâ€™er be sad;<br/>
For the love of Jesus<br/>
Makes His children glad.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Happy little pilgrims,<br/>
Going on our way,<br/>
To a land of beauty,<br/>
Singing all the day.<br/>
<br/>
In that land so lovely,<br/>
Everything is bright,<br/>
There will be no sorrow,<br/>
There will be no night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Not alone we journey<br/>
To the mansions fair;<br/>
Jesus is our Shepherd;<br/>
He will lead us there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
