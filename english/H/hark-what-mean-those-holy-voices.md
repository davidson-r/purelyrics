<br/>
Hark! what mean those holy voices,<br/>
Sweetly sounding through the skies?<br/>
Lo! the angelic host rejoices<br/>
Heavenly hallelujahs rise.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to the wondrous story,<br/>
Which they chant in hymns of joy;<br/>
“Glory in the highest, glory;<br/>
Glory be to God most high!<br/>
<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will from heaven,<br/>
Reaching far as man is found;<br/>
Souls redeemed, and sins forgiven;<br/>
Loud our golden harps shall sound.<br/>
<br/>
“Christ is born, the great Anointed;<br/>
Heaven and earth His praises sing:<br/>
O receive whom God appointed,<br/>
For your Prophet, Priest and King.<br/>
<br/>
“Hasten, mortals to adore Him;<br/>
Learn His Name and taste His joy;<br/>
Till in heaven you sing before Him,<br/>
Glory be to God most high!”<br/>
<br/>
Let us learn the wondrous story<br/>
Of our great Redeemer’s birth;<br/>
Spread the brightness of His glory<br/>
Till it cover all the earth.<br/>
