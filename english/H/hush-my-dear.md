<br/>
Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,<br/>
Holy angels guard thy bed,<br/>
Heav’nly blessings without number,<br/>
Gently falling on they head.<br/>
How much better thou’rt attended,<br/>
Than the Son of God could be,<br/>
When from Heaven He descended,<br/>
And became a child like thee!<br/>
<br/>
Soft and easy is thy cradle,<br/>
Coarse and hard thy Savior lay:<br/>
When His birthplace was a stable,<br/>
And His softest bed was hay.<br/>
Oh, to tell the wondrous story,<br/>
How His foes abused their King;<br/>
How they killed the Lord of glory,<br/>
Makes me angry while I sing.<br/>
<br/>
Hush, my child, I did not chide thee,<br/>
Though my song may seem so hard;<br/>
’Tis thy mother sits beside thee,<br/>
And her arms shall be thy guard.<br/>
May’st thou learn to know and fear Him,<br/>
Love and serve Him all thy days;<br/>
Then to dwell forever near Him,<br/>
Tell His love and sing His praise.<br/>
