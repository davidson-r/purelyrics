title: How Blest The Man

<br/>
How blest the man who thoughtfully<br/>
The poor and weak befriends;<br/>
Deliverance in the evil day<br/>
To him Jehovah sends.<br/>
The Lord will keep him, guard his life,<br/>
On earth he shall be blest;<br/>
The Lord will not surrender him<br/>
By foes to be distressed.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the bed of suffering<br/>
Jehovah will sustain,<br/>
And in his sickness God will soothe<br/>
The weariness and pain.<br/>
O Lord, to Thee my cry ascends,<br/>
Let me Thy mercy see;<br/>
Heal Thou my soul, for I have sinned,<br/>
I have offended Thee.<br/>
<br/>
My enemies against me speak,<br/>
And they my life have scorned;<br/>
They wish my name to pass away,<br/>
Unhonored and unmourned.<br/>
My foe, deceitful, visits me,<br/>
By seeming kindness led,<br/>
His heart intent on gathering<br/>
Some hurtful news to spread.<br/>
<br/>
My foes, together whispering,<br/>
Their evil plans devise;<br/>
Disease, they say, cleaves fast to him,<br/>
Laid low, he shall not rise.<br/>
Yea, he who was my chosen friend,<br/>
In whom I put my trust,<br/>
Who ate my bread, now turns in wrath<br/>
To crush me in the dust.<br/>
<br/>
Do Thou, Jehovah, show me grace,<br/>
And raise me up again,<br/>
That I with justice may requite<br/>
These base and wicked men.<br/>
By this I know assuredly<br/>
That I am loved by Thee,<br/>
Because my foe does not exult<br/>
In triumph over me.<br/>
<br/>
And as for me, in uprightness<br/>
Thou dost uphold me well,<br/>
And settest me before Thy face<br/>
Forevermore to dwell.<br/>
Blest be Jehovah, Israelâ€™s God<br/>
Forevermore. Amen.<br/>
Let age to age eternally<br/>
Repeat his praise. Amen.<br/>
