title: Hear This All Ye People Hear

<br/>
Hear this, all ye people, hear,<br/>
Earth’s inhabitants, give ear;<br/>
All of high and low degree,<br/>
Rich and poor, give heed to me.<br/>
<br/>
Truth with all my heart I seek,<br/>
And my mouth shall wisdom speak;<br/>
Hearken while in lyric strain<br/>
I make hidden wisdom plain.<br/>
<br/>
Why should I to fear give way<br/>
When I see the evil day,<br/>
When with wickedness my foes<br/>
Shall surround me and oppose?<br/>
<br/>
They that trust in treasured gold,<br/>
Though they boast of wealth untold,<br/>
None can bid his brother live,<br/>
None to God a ransom give.<br/>
<br/>
If from death one would be free<br/>
And corruption never see,<br/>
Costly is life’s ransom price,<br/>
Far beyond all sacrifice.<br/>
