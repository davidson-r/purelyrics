<br/>
Hearken, all! what holy singing<br/>
Now is sounding from the sky!<br/>
â€™Tis a hymn with grandeur ringing,<br/>
Sung by voices clear and high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo,<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
On the plain, the simple shepherds<br/>
Watched their flocks the long night through;<br/>
From on high they heard the voices,<br/>
Sounding through the heavenly blue.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
See, within the manger lowly,<br/>
Wide the Christ Child spreads His arms.<br/>
Raise to Him your joyful voices,<br/>
Sing we all Noel, Noel.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
