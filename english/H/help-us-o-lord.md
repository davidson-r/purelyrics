Help us, O Lord! Behold, we enter<br/>
Upon another year today;<br/>
In Thee our hopes and thoughts now center,<br/>
Renew our courage for the way.<br/>
New life, new strength, new happiness,<br/>
We ask of Thee—oh, hear and bless!<br/>
<br/>
May every plan and undertaking<br/>
This year be all begun with Thee;<br/>
When I am sleeping or am waking,<br/>
Still let me know Thou art with me.<br/>
Abroad do Thou my footsteps guide,<br/>
At home be ever at my side.<br/>
<br/>
Be this a time of grace and pardon.<br/>
Thy rod I take with willing mind,<br/>
But suffer naught my heart to harden;<br/>
Oh, let me then Thy mercy find!<br/>
In Thee alone, my God, I live;<br/>
Thou only canst my sins forgive.<br/>
<br/>
And may this year to me be holy;<br/>
Thy grace so fill my every thought<br/>
That all my life be pure and lowly<br/>
And truthful, as a Christian’s ought.<br/>
So make me while yet dwelling here<br/>
Pious and blest from year to year.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, be with me and direct me;<br/>
Jesus, my plans and hopes inspire;<br/>
Jesus, from tempting thoughts protect me;<br/>
Jesus, be all my heart’s desire;<br/>
Jesus, be in my thoughts all day<br/>
Nor suffer me to fall away.<br/>
<br/>
And grant, Lord, when the year is over,<br/>
That it for me in peace may close;<br/>
In all things care for me and cover<br/>
My head in time of fear and woes.<br/>
So may I when my years are gone<br/>
Appear with joy before Thy throne.
