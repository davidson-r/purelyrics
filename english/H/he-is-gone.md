<br/>
He is gone—a cloud of light<br/>
Has received Him from our sight;<br/>
High in Heav’n, where eye of men<br/>
Follows not, nor angels’ ken;<br/>
Through the veils of time and space,<br/>
Passed into the holiest place;<br/>
All the toil, the sorrow done,<br/>
All the battle fought and won.<br/>
<br/>
He is gone—and we remain<br/>
In this world of sin and pain:<br/>
In the void which He has left<br/>
On this earth, of Him bereft.<br/>
We have still His work to do,<br/>
We can still His path pursue;<br/>
Seek Him both in friend and foe,<br/>
In ourselves His image show.<br/>
<br/>
He is gone—we heard Him say,<br/>
“Good that I should go away,”<br/>
Gone is that dear form and face,<br/>
But not gone His present grace;<br/>
Though Himself no more we see,<br/>
Comfortless we cannot be:<br/>
No, His Spirit still is ours,<br/>
Quickening, freshening all ours powers.<br/>
<br/>
He is gone—towards their goal<br/>
World and church must onward roll;<br/>
Far behind we leave the past;<br/>
Forward are our glances cast:<br/>
Still His words before us range<br/>
Through the ages as they change:<br/>
Wheresoe’er the truth shall lead,<br/>
He will give whate’er we need.<br/>
<br/>
He is gone—but we once more<br/>
Shall behold Him as before;<br/>
In the heaven of heavens the same,<br/>
As on earth He went and came;<br/>
In the many mansions there,<br/>
Place for us He will prepare;<br/>
In that world unseen, unknown,<br/>
He and we shall yet be one.<br/>
<br/>
He is gone—but not in vain,<br/>
Wait until He comes again:<br/>
He is risen, He is not here,<br/>
Far above this earthly sphere;<br/>
Evermore in heart and mind<br/>
There our peace in Him we find:<br/>
To our own eternal Friend,<br/>
Thitherward let us ascend.<br/>
