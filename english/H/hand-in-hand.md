<br/>
Now begin the heavenly race—<br/>
The Savior calls today;<br/>
Let us early seek His face,<br/>
And early learn to pray.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hand in hand we’ll journey on,<br/>
Reaching forward to the prize,<br/>
Hoping, trusting in the Lord,<br/>
Where all our vigor lies.<br/>
<br/>
He Who left His Father’s throne,<br/>
To suffer, bleed and die,<br/>
He Who made our grief his own,<br/>
Will every want supply.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
They who on His Name believe,<br/>
And patiently endure,<br/>
Life eternal shall receive,<br/>
And find His mercy sure.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Now begin the heavenly race,<br/>
No more, no more delay;<br/>
To the healing fount of grace,<br/>
Rejoicing, haste away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
