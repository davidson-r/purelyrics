<br/>
Honor and glory, power and salvation<br/>
Be in the highest unto Him Who reigneth,<br/>
Changeless in Heaven, over earthly changes,<br/>
God the eternal.<br/>
<br/>
Bow down before Him, people and nations,<br/>
See ye His glory, clearly now appearing,<br/>
Come ye and worship Him, God in the highest,<br/>
Ruler forever.<br/>
