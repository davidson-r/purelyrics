<br/>
Hark! The skies with music sound,<br/>
Heav’nly glory beams around;<br/>
Christ is born! the angels sing<br/>
Glory to the newborn King.<br/>
<br/>
Peace is come, goodwill appears;<br/>
Sinners wipe away your tears;<br/>
Christ for you in flesh today<br/>
Humbly in the manger lay.<br/>
<br/>
Shepherds, tending flocks by night,<br/>
Heard the song, and saw the light;<br/>
Took their reeds, and softest strains<br/>
Echoed through the happy plains.<br/>
<br/>
Mortals, hail the glorious King!<br/>
Richest incense cheerful bring;<br/>
Praise and love Immanuel’s Name,<br/>
And His boundless grace proclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Glory, praise, and blessing be,<br/>
Lord, our Savior, unto Thee;<br/>
Thee let heaven and earth adore,<br/>
God o’er all forevermore.<br/>
