title: Have Courage To Say No

<center>
You’re starting, my boy, on life’s journey,<br/>
Along the grand highway of life;<br/>
You’ll meet with a thousand temptations<br/>
Each city with evil is rife.<br/>
This world is a stage of excitement,<br/>
There’s danger wherever you go;<br/>
But if you are tempted to weakness,<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
Have courage, my boy,<br/>
Have courage, my boy,<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
<br/>
In courage, my boy, lies your safety,<br/>
When you the long journey begin,<br/>
Your trust in a heavenly Father<br/>
Will keep you unspotted from sin.<br/>
Temptations will go on increasing,<br/>
As streams from a rivulet flow;<br/>
But if you’d be true to your manhood,<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Be careful in choosing companions,<br/>
Seek only the brave and the true,<br/>
And stand by your friends when in trial,<br/>
Ne’er changing the old for the new;<br/>
And when by false friends you are tempted<br/>
The taste of the wine cup to know,<br/>
With firmness, with patience and kindness,<br/>
Have courage, my boy, to say No!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
