title: He Who Would Valiant Be

<br/>
He who would valiant be ’gainst all disaster,<br/>
Let him in constancy follow the Master.<br/>
There’s no discouragement shall make him once relent<br/>
His first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.<br/>
<br/>
Who so beset him round with dismal stories<br/>
Do but themselves confound - his strength the more is.<br/>
No foes shall stay his might; though he with giants fight,<br/>
He will make good his right to be a pilgrim.<br/>
<br/>
Since, Lord, Thou dost defend us with Thy Spirit,<br/>
We know we at the end, shall life inherit.<br/>
Then fancies flee away! I’ll fear not what men say,<br/>
I’ll labor night and day to be a pilgrim.<br/>
