<br/>
Hark, the sounds melodious stealing<br/>
Thro’ the quiet midnight air;<br/>
Sweet, seraphic music pealing<br/>
Over all the landscape fair.<br/>
Angel hosts of brightest glory,<br/>
Hover o’er a lowly bed<br/>
Bed of Him foretold in story,<br/>
Son of Man, creation’s Head.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Singing, Glory to God,<br/>
Glory to God,<br/>
Glory to God in the highest,<br/>
Singing, Glory to God,<br/>
Glory to God,<br/>
Glory to God in the highest,<br/>
<br/>
Wise men traveled till they found Him,<br/>
Found a King in Bethlehem!<br/>
King, with sheep and cattle ’round Him?<br/>
King, without a diadem?<br/>
Yes! the Prince of Peace eternal,<br/>
King of kings, of lords the Lord!<br/>
Hark! the swelling choirs supernal<br/>
As they join with one accord:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Let us lift our hearts and voices<br/>
Prince Immanuel’s praise to sing;<br/>
While the heav’nly host rejoices,<br/>
Let us, too, our tribute bring.<br/>
Heav’nward, now, His star is pointing,<br/>
Where He sits at God’s right hand,<br/>
Unto each His crown appointing,<br/>
Who before His throne shall stand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
