<br/>
My blessèd Lord was crucified,<br/>
The day was dark, and grief was wide,<br/>
For hope was crushed and all seemed vain,<br/>
Until that Savior rose again.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Ring out the blessèd news again!<br/>
Oh! bear aloft the strain;<br/>
The mighty Lord is ris’n in power,<br/>
He died, but not in vain!<br/>
<br/>
He brings His great salvation nigh,<br/>
And on His love bids us rely;<br/>
He bought our peace through grief and pain;<br/>
But oh! He did not die in vain!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O, wondrous news of life and love!<br/>
That Jesus lives and reigns above!<br/>
He made the path to glory plain;<br/>
Ah, no! He did not die in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
