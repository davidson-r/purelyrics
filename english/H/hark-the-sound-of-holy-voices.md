<br/>
Hark! the sound of holy voices, chanting at the crystal sea,<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Lord, to Thee;<br/>
Multitude, which none can number, like the stars in glory stand<br/>
Clothed in white apparel, holding palms of victory in their hand.<br/>
<br/>
Patriarch, and holy prophet, who prepared the way of Christ<br/>
King, apostle, saint, confessor, martyr and evangelist;<br/>
Saintly maiden, godly matron, widows who have watched to prayer<br/>
Joined in holy concert, singing to the Lord of all, are there.<br/>
<br/>
They have come from tribulation, and have washed their robes in blood,<br/>
Washed them in the blood of Jesus; tried they were, and firm they stood;<br/>
Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented, sawn asunder, slain with sword;<br/>
They have conquered death and Satan by the might of Christ the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Marching with Thy cross their banner, they have triumphed, following<br/>
Thee, the Captain of salvation, Thee, their Savior and their King;<br/>
Gladly, Lord, with Thee they suffered; gladly, Lord, with Thee they died;<br/>
And by death to life immortal they were born and glorified.<br/>
<br/>
Now they reign in heav’nly glory, now they walk in golden light,<br/>
Now they drink, as from a river, holy bliss and infinite:<br/>
Love and peace they taste forever, and all truth and knowledge see<br/>
In the beatific vision of the blessèd Trinity.<br/>
<br/>
God of God, the One begotten, Light of light, Emmanuel,<br/>
In Whose body joined together all the saints forever dwell;<br/>
Pour upon us of Thy fullness that we may forevermore<br/>
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost adore.<br/>
