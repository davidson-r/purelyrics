title: Hush Blessed Are The Dead

<br/>
Hush! blessèd are the dead<br/>
In Jesus’ arms who rest,<br/>
And lean their weary head<br/>
Forever on His breast.<br/>
<br/>
O beatific sight!<br/>
No darkling veil between,<br/>
They see the Light of Light,<br/>
Whom here they loved unseen.<br/>
<br/>
Them the Good Shepherd leads,<br/>
Where storms are never rife,<br/>
In tranquil dewy meads<br/>
Beside the Fount of Life.<br/>
<br/>
O tender hearts and true,<br/>
Our long last vigil kept,<br/>
We weep and mourn for you;<br/>
Nor blame us: Jesus wept.<br/>
<br/>
But soon at break of day<br/>
His calm almighty voice,<br/>
Stronger than death, shall say,<br/>
Awake! Arise! Rejoice!<br/>
