title: Hosanna We Sing

Hosanna we sing, like the children dear,<br/>
In the olden days when the Lord lived here;<br/>
He blessed little children, and smiled on them,<br/>
While they chanted His praise in Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia we sing, like the children bright,<br/>
With their harps of gold and their raiment white,<br/>
As they follow their Shepherd with loving eyes,<br/>
Through the beautiful valleys of Paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Hosanna we sing, for He bends His ear,<br/>
And rejoices the hymns of His own to hear;<br/>
We know that His heart will never wax cold<br/>
To the lambs that He feeds in His earthly fold.<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia we sing in the Church we love,<br/>
Alleluia resounds in the Church above,<br/>
To Thy little ones, Lord, may such grace be given,<br/>
That we lose not our part in the song of Heavâ€™n.
