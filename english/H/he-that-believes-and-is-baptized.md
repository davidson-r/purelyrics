title: He That Believes And Is Baptized

<center>
He that believes and is baptized<br/>
Shall see the Lord’s salvation;<br/>
Baptized into the death of Christ,<br/>
He is a new creation.<br/>
Through Christ’s redemption he shall stand<br/>
Among the glorious heavenly band<br/>
Of every tribe and nation.<br/>
<br/>
With one accord, O God, we pray:<br/>
Grant us Thy Holy Spirit;<br/>
Look Thou on our infirmity<br/>
Through Jesus’ blood and merit.<br/>
Grant us to grow in grace each day<br/>
That by this sacrament we<br/>
Eternal life inherit.
