<br/>
The holy Son of God most high,<br/>
For love of Adam’s lapsèd race,<br/>
Quit the sweet pleasures of the sky<br/>
To bring us to that happy place.<br/>
<br/>
His robes of light He laid aside,<br/>
Which did His majesty adorn,<br/>
And the frail state of mortals tried,<br/>
In human flesh and figure born.<br/>
<br/>
Whole choirs of angels loudly sing<br/>
The mystery of His sacred birth,<br/>
And the blest news to shepherds bring,<br/>
Filling their watchful souls with mirth.<br/>
<br/>
The Son of God thus man became,<br/>
That men the sons of God might be,<br/>
And by their second birth regain<br/>
A likeness to His deity.<br/>
