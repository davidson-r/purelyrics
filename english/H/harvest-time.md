<br/>
The harvest fields are bending<br/>
With precious ripened grain;<br/>
More reapers now are needed,<br/>
Ere Christ comes back again.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Harvest time! Harvest time!<br/>
Precious Gospel seed is sown.<br/>
Reapers go! Reapers go!<br/>
Jesus, King, must have His own, His loved ones;<br/>
Soon He’ll come! Soon He’ll come!<br/>
Come and catch away His Bride, His own!<br/>
His own! His own!<br/>
<br/>
The call must now be heeded,<br/>
We cannot say Him nay;<br/>
Since He has died to save them,<br/>
We must go forth today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’ll come again rejoicing,<br/>
A reaper’s crown to gain;<br/>
The Harvest Home is coming,<br/>
When Christ comes back again.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
