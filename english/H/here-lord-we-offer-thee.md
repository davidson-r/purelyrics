<br/>
Here, Lord, we offer Thee all that is fairest,<br/>
Bloom from the garden, and flowers from the field;<br/>
Gifts for the stricken ones, knowing Thou carest<br/>
More for the love than the wealth that we yield.<br/>
<br/>
Send, Lord, by these to the sick and the dying,<br/>
Speak to their hearts with a message of peace;<br/>
Comfort the sad, who in weakness are lying,<br/>
Grant the departing a gentle release.<br/>
<br/>
Raise, Lord, to health those again who have sickened,<br/>
Fair be their lives as the roses in bloom;<br/>
Give of Thy grace to the souls Thou hast quickened,<br/>
Gladness for sorrow, and brightness for gloom.<br/>
<br/>
We, Lord, like flowers, must bloom and must wither;<br/>
We, like these blooms, must fade and must die;<br/>
Gather us, Lord, to Thy bosom forever,<br/>
Grant us a place in Thy house in the sky.<br/>
