title: Hymn Of Promise

<br/>
In the bulb there is a flower; in the seed, an apple tree;<br/>
In cocoons, a hidden promise: butterflies will soon be free!<br/>
In the cold and snow of winter there’s a spring that waits to be,<br/>
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a song in every silence, seeking word and melody;<br/>
There’s a dawn in every darkness, bringing hope to you and me.<br/>
From the past will come the future; what it holds, a mystery,<br/>
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.<br/>
<br/>
In our end is our beginning; in our time, infinity;<br/>
In our doubt there is believing; in our life, eternity,<br/>
In our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory,<br/>
Unrevealed until its season, something God alone can see.<br/>
