<br/>
How strong and sweet my Fatherâ€™s care,<br/>
That round about me, like the air,<br/>
Is with me always, everywhere!<br/>
He cares for me!<br/>
<br/>
The thought great wonder with it brings,<br/>
My cares are all such little things,<br/>
But to the truth my glad heart clings,<br/>
He cares for me!<br/>
<br/>
O keep me ever in Thy love,<br/>
Dear Father, watching from above,<br/>
And as through life my steps shall move,<br/>
O care for me.<br/>
