<br/>
Hark, the sound of coming legions,<br/>
O how joyful is the sound,<br/>
’Tis the children’s army marching,<br/>
On the Master’s errands bound.<br/>
See their faces all are glowing<br/>
With the joyous light of youth<br/>
As they’re marching, onward marching<br/>
For the cause of Right and Truth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,<br/>
O how joyful is the sound,<br/>
’Tis the children’s army marching,<br/>
On the Master’s errands bound.<br/>
<br/>
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,<br/>
Hosts of Satan now must quail,<br/>
They must scatter in confusion<br/>
When this army shall prevail.<br/>
At the summons of the Master,<br/>
See the children fall in line,<br/>
Marching on with glad endeavor,<br/>
Trusting in the help divine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hark, the tramp of coming legions,<br/>
Marching onward millions strong,<br/>
They shall surely be victorious<br/>
O’er the hosts of sin and wrong.<br/>
Ever loyal to the Master,<br/>
Strong their hearts shall be and brave,<br/>
Till the Gospel’s glorious banner<br/>
Over all the world shall wave.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
