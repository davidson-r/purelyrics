How beautiful the sight<br/>
Of brethren who agree<br/>
In friendship to unite,<br/>
And bonds of charity;<br/>
’Tis like the precious ointment, shed<br/>
O’er all his robes, from Aaron’s head.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis like the dews that fill<br/>
The cups of Hermon’s flowers;<br/>
Or Zion’s fruitful hill,<br/>
Bright with the drops of showers,<br/>
When mingling odors breathe around,<br/>
And glory rests on all the ground<br/>
<br/>
For there the Lord commands<br/>
Blessings, a boundless store,<br/>
From His unsparing hands,<br/>
Yea, life forevermore;<br/>
Thrice happy they who meet above<br/>
To spend eternity in love!
