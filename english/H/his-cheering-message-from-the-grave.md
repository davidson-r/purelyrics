<br/>
His cheering message from the grave<br/>
An angel to the women gave:<br/>
“Full soon your Master ye shall see;<br/>
He goes before to Galilee.”<br/>
<br/>
But while with flying steps they press<br/>
To bear the news, all eagerness,<br/>
Their Lord, the living Lord, they meet,<br/>
And prostrate fall to kiss His feet.<br/>
<br/>
So when His mourning followers heard<br/>
The tidings of that faithful word,<br/>
Quick went they forth to Galilee,<br/>
Their loved and lost once more to see.<br/>
<br/>
On that fair day of Paschal joy<br/>
The sunshine was without alloy,<br/>
When to their very eyes restored<br/>
They looked upon the risen Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The wounds before their eyes displayed<br/>
They see in living light arrayed,<br/>
And that they see they testify<br/>
In open witness fearlessly.<br/>
<br/>
O Christ, the King of gentleness,<br/>
Our several hearts do Thou possess,<br/>
They we may render all our days<br/>
Thy meed of thankfulness and praise.<br/>
<br/>
Maker of all, to Thee we pray,<br/>
Fulfill in us Thy joy today;<br/>
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we<br/>
May share Thy Paschal victory.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee Who, dead, again dost live,<br/>
All glory, Lord, Thy people give;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To Father and to Paraclete.<br/>
