<br/>
Holy Ghost, Illuminator,<br/>
Shed Thy Beams Upon Eyes,<br/>
Help Us To Look Up With Stephen,<br/>
And To See, Beyond The Skies,<br/>
Where The Son Of Man In Glory<br/>
Standing Is At God's Right Hand,<br/>
Beckoning On His Martyr Army,<br/>
Succoring His Faithful Band.<br/>
<br/>
See Him, Who Is Gone Before Us,<br/>
Heavenly Mansions To Prepare;<br/>
See Him, Who Is Ever Pleading<br/>
For Us With Prevailing Prayer;<br/>
See Him, Who With Sound Of Trumpet<br/>
And With His Angelic Train,<br/>
Summoning The World To Judgment,<br/>
On The Clouds Will Come Again.<br/>
<br/>
Lift Us Up From Earth To Heaven,<br/>
Give Us Wings Of Faith And Love,<br/>
Gales Of Holy Aspirations<br/>
Wafting Us To Realms Above;<br/>
That, With Hearts And Minds Uplifted,<br/>
We With Christ Our Lord May Dwell,<br/>
Where He Sits Enthroned In Glory<br/>
In His Heavenly Citadel.<br/>
<br/>
So At Last, When He Appeareth,<br/>
We From Out Our Graves May Spring,<br/>
With Our Youth Renewed Like Eagles,<br/>
Flocking Round Our Heavenly King,<br/>
Caught Up On The Clouds Of Heaven,<br/>
And May Meet Him In The Air,<br/>
Rise To Realms Where He Is Reigning,<br/>
And May Reign For Ever There.<br/>
<br/>
Glory Be To God The Father,<br/>
Glory Be To God The Son,<br/>
Dying, Risen, Ascending For Us,<br/>
Who The Heavenly Realm Has Won.<br/>
Glory To The Holy Spirit;<br/>
To One God In Persons Three<br/>
Glory Both In Earth And Heaven,<br/>
Glory, Endless Glory Be.<br/>
