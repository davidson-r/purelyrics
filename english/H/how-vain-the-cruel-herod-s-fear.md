<br/>
How vain the cruel Herod’s fear,<br/>
When told that Christ the King is near!<br/>
He takes not earthly realms away,<br/>
Who gives the realms that ne’er decay.<br/>
<br/>
The Eastern sages saw from far<br/>
And followed on His guiding star;<br/>
By light their way to Light they trod,<br/>
And by their gifts confessed their God.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Jordan’s sacred flood<br/>
The heavenly Lamb in meekness stood,<br/>
That He to Whom no sin was known,<br/>
Might cleanse His people from their own.<br/>
<br/>
And oh, what miracle divine,<br/>
When water reddened into wine!<br/>
He spake the word, and forth it flowed<br/>
In streams that nature ne’er bestowed.<br/>
<br/>
All glory, Jesu, be to Thee<br/>
For this Thy glad Epiphany:<br/>
Whom with the Father we adore<br/>
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br/>
