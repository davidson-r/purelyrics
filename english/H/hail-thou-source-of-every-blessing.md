<br/>
Hail, Thou Source of every blessing,<br/>
Sovereign Father of mankind!<br/>
Gentiles now, Thy grace possessing,<br/>
In Thy courts admission find.<br/>
Grateful now we fall before Thee,<br/>
In Thy Church obtain a place,<br/>
Now by faith behold Thy glory,<br/>
Praise Thy truth, adore Thy grace.<br/>
<br/>
Once far off, but now invited,<br/>
We approach Thy sacred throne;<br/>
In Thy covenant united,<br/>
Reconciled, redeemed, made one.<br/>
Now revealed to Eastern sages,<br/>
See the Star of Mercy shine;<br/>
Mystery hid in former ages,<br/>
Mystery great of love divine.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, Thou all-inviting Savior!<br/>
Gentiles now their offerings bring;<br/>
In Thy temple seek Thy favor,<br/>
Jesus Christ, our Lord and King.<br/>
May we, body, soul, and spirit,<br/>
Live devoted to Thy praise,<br/>
Glorious realms of bliss inherit,<br/>
Grateful anthems ever raise!<br/>
