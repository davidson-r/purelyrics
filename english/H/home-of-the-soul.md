<br/>
I will sing you a song of that beautiful land,<br/>
The far away home of the soul,<br/>
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,<br/>
While the years of eternity roll,<br/>
While the years of eternity roll;<br/>
Where no storms ever beat on the glittering strand,<br/>
While the years of eternity roll.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that home of the soul! In my visions and dreams<br/>
Its bright, jasper walls I can see;<br/>
Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes<br/>
Between the fair city and me,<br/>
Between the fair city and me;<br/>
Till I fancy but thinly the veil intervenes<br/>
Between the fair city and me.<br/>
<br/>
That unchangeable home is for you and for me,<br/>
Where Jesus of Nazareth stands;<br/>
The King of all kingdoms forever is He,<br/>
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands,<br/>
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands;<br/>
The King of all kingdoms forever is He,<br/>
And He holdeth our crowns in His hands.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how sweet it will be in that beautiful land,<br/>
So free from all sorrow and pain,<br/>
With songs on our lips and our harps in our hands,<br/>
To meet one another again,<br/>
To meet one another again;<br/>
With songs on our lips and our harps in our hands,<br/>
To meet one another again.<br/>
