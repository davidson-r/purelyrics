<br/>
Hail, O Star of the ocean, God's own Mother blest,<br/>
ever sinless Virgin, gate of heav'nly rest.<br/>
<br/>
Taking that sweet Ave, which from Gabriel came,<br/>
peace confirm within us, changing Eve's name.<br/>
<br/>
Break the sinners' fetters, make our blindness day,<br/>
Chase all evils from us, for all blessings pray.<br/>
<br/>
Show thyself a Mother, may the Word divine<br/>
born for us thine Infant hear our prayers through thine.<br/>
<br/>
Virgin all excelling, mildest of the mild,<br/>
free from guilt preserve us meek and undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
Keep our life all spotless, make our way secure<br/>
till we find in Jesus, joy for evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to God the Father, honor to the Son,<br/>
in the Holy Spirit, be the glory one. <br/>
Amen.Â  <br/>
