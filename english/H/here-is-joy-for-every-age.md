<br/>
Here is joy for every age,<br/>
Every generation;<br/>
Prince and peasant, chief and sage,<br/>
Every tongue and nation:<br/>
Every tongue and nation,<br/>
Every rank and station<br/>
Hath today salvation,<br/>
Alle Alleluia.<br/>
<br/>
When the world drew near its close,<br/>
Came out Lord and Leader;<br/>
From the Lily sprang the Rose,<br/>
From the Bush the Cedar;<br/>
From the Bush the Cedar,<br/>
From the judged the Pleader,<br/>
From the faint the Feeder:<br/>
Alle Alleluia.<br/>
<br/>
God, that came on earth this morn,<br/>
In a manger lying,<br/>
Hallowed birth by being born,<br/>
Vanquished death by dying;<br/>
Vanquished death by dying,<br/>
Rallied back the flying,<br/>
Ended sin and sighing:<br/>
Alle Alleluia.<br/>
