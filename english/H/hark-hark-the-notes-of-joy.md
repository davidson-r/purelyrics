<br/>
Hark! Hark! The notes of joy<br/>
Roll o’er the heavenly plains,<br/>
And seraphs find employ<br/>
For their sublimest strains;<br/>
Some new delight in heaven is known,<br/>
Loud sound the harps around the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! Hark! The sounds draw nigh,<br/>
The joyful hosts descend;<br/>
Jesus forsakes the sky,<br/>
To earth His footsteps bend;<br/>
He comes to bless our fallen race;<br/>
He comes with messages of grace.<br/>
<br/>
Bear, bear the tidings round;<br/>
Let every mortal know<br/>
What love in God is found,<br/>
What pity He can show;<br/>
Ye winds that blow! ye waves that roll!<br/>
Bear the glad news from pole to pole.<br/>
<br/>
Strike, strike the harps again,<br/>
To great Immanuel’s Name;<br/>
Arise, ye sons of men!<br/>
And all His grace proclaim;<br/>
Angels and men! wake every string<br/>
’Tis God the Savior’s praise we sing.<br/>
