<br/>
Hush, all ye sounds of war, ye nations all be still,<br/>
A voice of heav’nly joy steals over vale and hill,<br/>
O hear the angels sing the captive world’s release,<br/>
This day is born in Bethlehem the Prince of Peace.<br/>
<br/>
No more divided be, ye families of men,<br/>
Old enmity forget, old friendship knit again,<br/>
In the new year of God let brothers’ love increase,<br/>
This day is born in Bethlehem the Prince of Peace.<br/>
