<br/>
Hail the day that sees Him rise, Alleluia!<br/>
To His throne above the skies, Alleluia!<br/>
Christ, awhile to mortals given, Alleluia!<br/>
Reascends His native heaven, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
There the glorious triumph waits, Alleluia!<br/>
Lift your heads, eternal gates, Alleluia!<br/>
Christ hath conquered death and sin, Alleluia!<br/>
Take the King of glory in, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Circled round with angel powers, Alleluia!<br/>
Their triumphant Lord, and ours, Alleluia!<br/>
Conqueror over death and sin, Alleluia!<br/>
“Take the King of glory in! Alleluia!”<br/>
<br/>
Him though highest Heav’n receives, Alleluia!<br/>
Still He loves the earth He leaves, Alleluia!<br/>
Though returning to His throne, Alleluia!<br/>
Still He calls mankind His own, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
See! He lifts His hands above, Alleluia!<br/>
See! He shows the prints of love, Alleluia!<br/>
Hark! His gracious lips bestow, Alleluia!<br/>
Blessings on His church below, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Still for us His death He pleads, Alleluia!<br/>
Prevalent He intercedes, Alleluia!<br/>
Near Himself prepares our place, Alleluia!<br/>
Harbinger of human race, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Master, (will we ever say), Alleluia!<br/>
Taken from our head to day, Alleluia!<br/>
See Thy faithful servants, see, Alleluia!<br/>
Ever gazing up to Thee, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Grant, though parted from our sight, Alleluia!<br/>
Far above yon azure height, Alleluia!<br/>
Grant our hearts may thither rise, Alleluia!<br/>
Seeking Thee beyond the skies, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Ever upward let us move, Alleluia!<br/>
Wafted on the wings of love, Alleluia!<br/>
Looking when our Lord shall come, Alleluia!<br/>
Longing, gasping after home, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
There we shall with Thee remain, Alleluia!<br/>
Partners of Thy endless reign, Alleluia!<br/>
There Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!<br/>
Find our heaven of heavens in Thee, Alleluia!<br/>
