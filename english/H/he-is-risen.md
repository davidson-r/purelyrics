title: He is Risen

Said the angel, “He is risen!”<br/>
Tell it out with joyful voice:<br/>
He has burst His three days’ prison;<br/>
Let the whole wide earth rejoice:<br/>
Death is conquered, we are free,<br/>
Christ has won the victory.<br/>
<br/>
Come, ye sad and fearful hearted,<br/>
With glad smile and radiant brow!<br/>
Death’s long shadows have departed;<br/>
All our woes are over now,<br/>
Due to passion that He bore<br/>
Sin and pain can vex no more.<br/>
<br/>
Come, with high and holy hymning,<br/>
Chant our Lord’s triumphant day;<br/>
Not one darksome cloud is dimming<br/>
Yonder glorious morning ray,<br/>
Breaking over the purple east:<br/>
Brighter far our Easter feast.<br/>
<br/>
He is risen, He is risen!<br/>
He has opened heaven’s gate:<br/>
We are free from sin’s dark prison,<br/>
Risen to a holier state;<br/>
And a brighter Easter beam<br/>
On our longing eyes shall stream.
