title: Hark A Voice Divides The Sky

<br/>
Hark! A voice divides the sky, happy are the faithful dead!<br/>
In the Lord who sweetly die, they from all their toils are freed;<br/>
Them the Spirit hath declared blessed, unutterably blessed;<br/>
Jesus is their great reward, Jesus is their endless rest.<br/>
<br/>
Followed by their works, they go where their Head has gone before;<br/>
Reconciled by grace below, grace has opened mercy’s door;<br/>
Justified through faith alone, here they knew their sins forgiven,<br/>
Here they laid their burden down, hallowed, and made fit for heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Who can now lament the lot of a saint in Christ deceased?<br/>
Let the world, who know us not, call us hopeless and unblessed:<br/>
When from flesh the spirit freed hastens homeward to return,<br/>
Mortals cry, “A man is dead!” Angels sing, “A child is born!”<br/>
<br/>
Born into the world above, they our happy brother greet,<br/>
Bear him to the throne of love, place him at the Savior’s feet;<br/>
Jesus smiles, and says, “Well done, good and faithful servant thou;<br/>
Enter, and receive thy crown, reign with Me triumphant now.”<br/>
<br/>
Angels catch the approving sound, bow, and bless the just award;<br/>
Hail the heir with glory crowned, now rejoicing with his Lord:<br/>
Fuller joys ordained to know, waiting for the general doom,<br/>
When the archangel’s trump shall blow, “Rise, ye dead, to judgment come!”<br/>
