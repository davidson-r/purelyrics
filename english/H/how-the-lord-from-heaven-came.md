title: How The Lord From Heaven Came

<center>
I love to hear the story how the Lord from Heaven came<br/>
And did not fear to visit men in all their sin and shame;<br/>
But touched the sick and made them well, the blind and they did see,<br/>
And said of little children, “Suffer them to come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
I love to think of Jesus as my gentle Shepherd Lord<br/>
Who leads in heav’nly pastures those who love to hear His Word;<br/>
And when I am in sorrow, and sore trouble makes me fear,<br/>
I hear Him say: “Be not afraid, My child, for I am near!”<br/>
<br/>
I love to speak to Him alone in words of song and prayer<br/>
In darkest night and roughest way, for He is with me there;<br/>
And so He guides me that each day I may not fail to see<br/>
The way to Heav’n, that where He is, there also may I be.
