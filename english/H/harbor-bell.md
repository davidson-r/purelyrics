<br/>
Our life is like a stormy sea<br/>
Swept by the gales of sin and grief,<br/>
While on the windward and the lee<br/>
Hang heavy clouds of unbelief;<br/>
But o’er the deep a call we hear,<br/>
Like harbor bell’s inviting voice;<br/>
It tells the lost that hope is near,<br/>
And bids the trembling soul rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
This way, this way, O heart oppressed,<br/>
So long by storm and tempest driv’n;<br/>
This way, this way, lo here is rest,<br/>
Rings out the harbor bell of Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O let us now the call obey,<br/>
And steer our bark for yonder shore,<br/>
Where still that voice directs the way,<br/>
In pleading tones forevermore;<br/>
A thousand life wrecks strew the sea;<br/>
They’re going down at every swell;<br/>
“Come unto Me, come unto Me,”<br/>
Rings out th’ assuring harbor bell.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O tempted one, look up, be strong;<br/>
The promise of the Lord is sure,<br/>
That they shall sing the victor’s song,<br/>
Who faithful to the end endure;<br/>
God’s Holy Spirit comes to thee,<br/>
Of His abiding love to tell;<br/>
To blissful port, o’er stormy sea,<br/>
Calls Heav’n’s inviting harbor bell.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Come, gracious Lord, and in Thy love<br/>
Conduct us o’er life’s stormy wave;<br/>
O guide us to the home above,<br/>
The blissful home beyond the grave;<br/>
There safe from rock, and storm, and flood,<br/>
Our song of praise shall never cease,<br/>
To Him Who bought us with His blood,<br/>
And brought us to the port of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
