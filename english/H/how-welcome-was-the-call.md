title: How Welcome Was The Call

How welcome was the call,<br/>
And sweet the festal lay,<br/>
When Jesus deigned in Cana’s hall<br/>
To bless the marriage day!<br/>
<br/>
And happy was the bride,<br/>
And glad the bridegroom’s heart,<br/>
For He Who tarried at their side<br/>
Bade grief and ill depart.<br/>
<br/>
His gracious power divine<br/>
The water vessels knew;<br/>
And plenteous was the mystic wine<br/>
The wondering servants drew.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord of life and love,<br/>
Come Thou again today;<br/>
And bring a blessing from above<br/>
That ne’er shall pass away.<br/>
<br/>
O bless, as erst of old,<br/>
The bridegroom and the bride;<br/>
Bless with the holier stream that flowed<br/>
Forth from Thy piercèd side.<br/>
<br/>
Before Thine altar throne<br/>
This mercy we implore;<br/>
As Thou dost knit them, Lord, in one,<br/>
So bless them evermore.
