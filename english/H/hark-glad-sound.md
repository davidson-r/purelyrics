Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,<br/>
The Savior promised long;<br/>
Let every heart prepare a throne,<br/>
And every voice a song.<br/>
<br/>
On Him the Spirit, largely poured,<br/>
Exerts His sacred fire;<br/>
Wisdom and might, and zeal and love,<br/>
His holy breast inspire.<br/>
<br/>
He comes the prisoners to release,<br/>
In Satan’s bondage held;<br/>
The gates of brass before Him burst,<br/>
The iron fetters yield.<br/>
<br/>
He comes, from thickest films of vice<br/>
To clear the mental ray,<br/>
And on the eyes oppressed with night<br/>
To pour celestial day.<br/>
<br/>
He comes the broken heart to bind,<br/>
The bleeding soul to cure;<br/>
And with the treasures of His grace<br/>
To enrich the humble poor.<br/>
<br/>
His silver trumpets publish loud<br/>
The jub’lee of the Lord<br/>
Our debts are all remitted now<br/>
Our heritage restored.<br/>
<br/>
Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,<br/>
Thy welcome shall proclaim;<br/>
And Heav’n’s eternal arches ring<br/>
With Thy belovèd Name.
