<br/>
While by the sheep we watched at night,<br/>
Glad tidings brought an angel bright.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How great our joy! Great our joy!<br/>
Joy, joy, joy! Joy, joy, joy!<br/>
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!<br/>
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!<br/>
<br/>
There shall be born, so He did say,<br/>
In Bethlehem a Child today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There shall the Child lie in a stall,<br/>
This Child who shall redeem us all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
This gift of God weâ€™ll cherish well,<br/>
That ever joy our hearts shall fill.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
