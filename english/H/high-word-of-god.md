High Word of God, Who once didst come,<br/>
Leaving Thy Father and Thy home,<br/>
To succor by Thy birth our kind,<br/>
When, towards Thy advent, time declined,<br/>
<br/>
Pour light upon us from above,<br/>
And fire our hearts with Thy strong love,<br/>
That, as we hear Thy Gospel read,<br/>
All fond desires may flee in dread;<br/>
<br/>
That when Thou comest from the skies,<br/>
Great Judge, to open Thine assize,<br/>
To give each hidden sin its smart,<br/>
And crown as kings the pure in heart,<br/>
<br/>
We be not set at Thy left hand,<br/>
Where sentence due would bid us stand,<br/>
But with the saints Thy face may see,<br/>
Forever wholly loving Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Father and the Son,<br/>
Through all the ages as they run;<br/>
And to the holy Paraclete<br/>
Be praise with Them and worship meet.
</center>
