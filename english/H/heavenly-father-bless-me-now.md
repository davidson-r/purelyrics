<br/>
Heavenly Father, bless me now;<br/>
At the cross of Christ I bow;<br/>
Take my guilt and grief away;<br/>
Hear and heal me now, I pray.<br/>
<br/>
Now, O Lord, this very hour,<br/>
Send Thy grace and show Thy power;<br/>
While I rest upon Thy Word;<br/>
Come, and bless me now, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Mercy now, O Lord, I plead<br/>
In this hour of utter need;<br/>
Turn me not away unblest;<br/>
Calm my anguish into rest.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou loving, blessèd One,<br/>
Rising o’er me like the sun,<br/>
Light and life art Thou within;<br/>
Savior, Thou, from every sin!<br/>
