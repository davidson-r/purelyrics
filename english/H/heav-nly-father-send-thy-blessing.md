<br/>
Heav’nly Father, send Thy blessing<br/>
On Thy children gathered here,<br/>
May they all, Thy Name confessing,<br/>
Be to Thee forever dear;<br/>
May they be, like Joseph, loving,<br/>
Dutiful, and chaste, and pure;<br/>
And their faith, like David, proving,<br/>
Steadfast unto death endure.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Savior, who in meekness<br/>
Didst vouchsafe a Child to be,<br/>
Guide their steps, and help their weakness,<br/>
Bless and make them like to Thee;<br/>
Bear Thy lambs, when they are weary,<br/>
In Thine arms and at Thy breast;<br/>
Through life’s desert, dry and dreary,<br/>
Bring them to Thy heav’nly rest.<br/>
<br/>
Spread Thy golden pinions o’er them,<br/>
Holy Spirit, from above,<br/>
Guide them, lead them, go before them,<br/>
Give them peace, and joy, and love;<br/>
Thy true temples, Holy Spirit,<br/>
May they with Thy glory shine,<br/>
And immortal bliss inherit,<br/>
And forevermore be Thine. <br/>
