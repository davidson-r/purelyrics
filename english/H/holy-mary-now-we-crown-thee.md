<br/>
Holy Mary now we crown thee<br/>
Honored Queen of all our race;<br/>
Noble Virgin, may our tribute<br/>
Win thy love and gain us grace.<br/>
Stain of sin hath never marred thee,<br/>
Mankind's only spotless bloom;<br/>
God whose might exceeds the heavens<br/>
Thou hast sheltered in thy womb. <br/>
<br/>
Glorious Queen, look down in kindness,<br/>
While before thy sight we stand,<br/>
Bring God's blessing to thy children,<br/>
Watch our homes and guard our land.<br/>
Gate of heaven, thou wert Mother<br/>
To the King of heav'n and earth,<br/>
Now be Mother to thy subjects,<br/>
In our souls give Jesus birth.Â  <br/>
