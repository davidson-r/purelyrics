title: Hark from on High

Hark from on high those blissful strains!<br/>
Whence can such sweetness be?<br/>
Have angels waked their golden harps<br/>
With Heav’ns own minstrelsy?<br/>
With Heav’ns own minstrelsy?<br/>
<br/>
Or do we hear the cherub voice<br/>
Of infant bands who raise,<br/>
Soaring from earth celestial notes<br/>
In their Creator’s praise?<br/>
In their Creator’s praise?<br/>
<br/>
Thus spake the shepherds - yet with dread,<br/>
So strange the sounds they heard,<br/>
While o’er their slumb’ring flocks they kept<br/>
Their wonted nightly guard,<br/>
Their wonted nightly guard.<br/>
<br/>
And soon they saw a dazzling light<br/>
Beam through the starry way,<br/>
And shining seraphs clust’ring where<br/>
The infant Jesus lay,<br/>
The infant Jesus lay.<br/>
<br/>
They came a Savior’s birth to tell,<br/>
And tunes of rapture sing;<br/>
Hence the glad notes that filled the air<br/>
Each swept his loudest string,<br/>
Each swept his loudest string.<br/>
<br/>
But now in accents soft and kind<br/>
The chieftain angel said,<br/>
“Heav’ns tidings of great joy we bear<br/>
Shepherds, be not afraid,<br/>
Shepherds, be not afraid.”
