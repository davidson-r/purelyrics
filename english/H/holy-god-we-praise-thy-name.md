<br/>
Holy God, we praise Thy Name;<br/>
Lord of all, we bow before Thee!<br/>
All on earth Thy scepter claim,<br/>
All in Heaven above adore Thee;<br/>
Infinite Thy vast domain,<br/>
Everlasting is Thy reign.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! the loud celestial hymn<br/>
Angel choirs above are raising,<br/>
Cherubim and seraphim,<br/>
In unceasing chorus praising;<br/>
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the apostolic train<br/>
Join the sacred Name to hallow;<br/>
Prophets swell the loud refrain,<br/>
And the white robed martyrs follow;<br/>
And from morn to set of sun,<br/>
Through the Church the song goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Father, Holy Son,<br/>
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;<br/>
While in essence only One,<br/>
Undivided God we claim Thee;<br/>
And adoring bend the knee,<br/>
While we own the mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art King of glory, Christ:<br/>
Son of God, yet born of Mary;<br/>
For us sinners sacrificed,<br/>
And to death a tributary:<br/>
First to break the bars of death,<br/>
Thou has opened Heaven to faith.<br/>
<br/>
From Thy high celestial home,<br/>
Judge of all, again returning,<br/>
We believe that Thou shalt come<br/>
In the dreaded doomsday morning;<br/>
When Thy voice shall shake the earth,<br/>
And the startled dead come forth.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore do we pray Thee, Lord:<br/>
Help Thy servants whom, redeeming<br/>
By Thy precious blood out-poured,<br/>
Thou hast saved from Satanâ€™s scheming.<br/>
Give to them eternal rest<br/>
In the glory of the blest.<br/>
<br/>
Spare Thy people, Lord, we pray,<br/>
By a thousand snares surrounded:<br/>
Keep us without sin today,<br/>
Never let us be confounded.<br/>
Lo, I put my trust in Thee;<br/>
Never, Lord, abandon me. <br/>
