title: He Smiles Within His Cradle

<center>
He smiles within his cradle,<br/>
A babe with face to bright<br/>
it beams most like a mirror<br/>
Against a blaze of light:<br/>
This babe so burning bright.<br/>
<br/>
This babe we now declare to you<br/>
Is Jesus Christ, our Lord;<br/>
He brings both peace and heartiness:<br/>
Haste, haste with one accord<br/>
To feast with Christ our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
And who would rock the cradle<br/>
Wherein this infant lies,<br/>
Must rock with easy motion<br/>
And watch with humble eyes,<br/>
Like Mary pure and wise.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, dearest babe of all<br/>
And dearest babe of mine,<br/>
Thy love is great, thy limbs are small<br/>
O flood this heart of mine<br/>
With overflow from thine!
