<br/>
How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds<br/>
In a believer’s ear!<br/>
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,<br/>
And drives away his fear.<br/>
<br/>
It makes the wounded spirit whole,<br/>
And calms the troubled breast;<br/>
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,<br/>
And to the weary, rest.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Name, the Rock on which I build,<br/>
My Shield and Hiding Place,<br/>
My never failing treasury, filled<br/>
With boundless stores of grace!<br/>
<br/>
By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,<br/>
Although with sin defiled;<br/>
Satan accuses me in vain,<br/>
And I am owned a child.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,<br/>
O Prophet, Priest and King,<br/>
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,<br/>
Accept the praise I bring.<br/>
<br/>
Weak is the effort of my heart,<br/>
And cold my warmest thought;<br/>
But when I see Thee as Thou art,<br/>
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.<br/>
<br/>
Till then I would Thy love proclaim<br/>
With every fleeting breath,<br/>
And may the music of Thy Name<br/>
Refresh my soul in death!<br/>
