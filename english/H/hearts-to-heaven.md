<center>
Alleluia, alleluia! Hearts to Heaven and voices raise:<br/>
Sing to God a hymn of gladness, sing to God a hymn of praise.<br/>
He, who on the cross a Victim, for the worldâ€™s salvation bled,<br/>
Jesus Christ, the King of glory, now is risen from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born,<br/>
Glorious life, and life immortal, on the holy Easter morn.<br/>
Christ has triumphed, and we conquer by His mighty enterprise:<br/>
We with Him to life eternal by His resurrection rise.<br/>
<br/>
Christ is risen, Christ, the first fruits of the holy harvest field,<br/>
Which will all its full abundance at His second coming yield:<br/>
Then the golden ears of harvest will their heads before Him wave,<br/>
Ripened by His glorious sunshine from the furrows of the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Christ is risen, we are risen! Shed upon us heavenly grace,<br/>
Rain and dew and gleams of glory from the brightness of Thy face;<br/>
That we, with our hearts in Heaven, here on earth may fruitful be,<br/>
And by angel hands be gathered, and be ever, Lord, with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia! Glory be to God on high;<br/>
Alleluia! to the Savior who has gained the victory;<br/>
Alleluia! to the Spirit, fount of love and sanctity:<br/>
Alleluia, alleluia! to the Triune Majesty.
