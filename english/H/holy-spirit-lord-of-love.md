<br/>
Holy Spirit, Lord of love, <br/>
thou who camest from above,<br/>
gifts of blessing to bestow <br/>
on your waiting Church below,<br/>
once again in love draw near <br/>
to thy servants gathered here.<br/>
From their bright baptismal day <br/>
thou hast led them on their way.<br/>
<br/>
When the sacred vow is made, <br/>
when the hands are on them laid,<br/>
come in this most solemn hour <br/>
with your strengthening gift of power.<br/>
Give them light thy truth to see: <br/>
give them life to live for thee,<br/>
daily power to conquer sin,<br/>
patient faith, the crown to win.Â  <br/>
