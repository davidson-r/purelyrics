Hark the herald angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn King!<br/>
Peace on earth and mercy mild<br/>
God and sinners reconciled"<br/>
Joyful, all ye nations rise<br/>
Join the triumph of the skies<br/>
With the angelic host proclaim:<br/>
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"<br/>
Hark! The herald angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br/>
<br/>
Christ by highest heav'n adored<br/>
Christ the everlasting Lord!<br/>
Late in time behold Him come<br/>
Offspring of a Virgin's womb<br/>
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see<br/>
Hail the incarnate Deity<br/>
Pleased as man with man to dwell<br/>
Jesus, our Emmanuel<br/>
Hark! The herald angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br/>
<br/>
Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!<br/>
Hail the Son of Righteousness!<br/>
Light and life to all He brings<br/>
Ris'n with healing in His wings<br/>
Mild He lays His glory by<br/>
Born that man no more may die<br/>
Born to raise the sons of earth<br/>
Born to give them second birth<br/>
Hark! The herald angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br/>
