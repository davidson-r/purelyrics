<br/>
Holy Queen, we come before thee,<br/>
Queen of purity divine,<br/>
Make us love thee, we implore thee,<br/>
Make us truly to be thine.<br/>
Thou by faith the gates unfolding<br/>
Of the kingdom in the skies<br/>
Hast to us, by faith beholding,<br/>
Shown the land of Paradise. <br/>
<br/>
Teach thy children, holy Mother,<br/>
How to conquer ev'ry sin,<br/>
How to love and help each other,<br/>
How eternal life to win<br/>
Thou to whom a Child was given<br/>
Greater than the sons of men,<br/>
Coming down from highest heaven<br/>
To create the world again. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, by that Almighty Maker<br/>
Whom thyself a virgin bore,<br/>
Oh, by that supreme Creator<br/>
Whom you praise forevermore,<br/>
By the hope thy name inspires,<br/>
By our doom reversed through thee,<br/>
Help us, Queen of angel choirs,<br/>
To a blest eternity. <br/>
