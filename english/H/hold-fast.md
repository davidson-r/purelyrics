<br/>
O sailor on a treacherous sea,<br/>
Tho’ rent thy every sail may be,<br/>
Tho’ all thy earthly hopes are past,<br/>
And thou art clinging to the mast.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hold fast a moment more,<br/>
Behold a light upon the shore;<br/>
Tho’ scarce a beam thine eye can see,<br/>
Thy Savior comes to rescue thee.<br/>
<br/>
Hold fast, be strong and banish fear,<br/>
Look up, behold the harbor near;<br/>
A cry of joy from yonder strand,<br/>
Where loved ones wait to clasp thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tho’ surges roll, and waves run high,<br/>
The Gospel lifeboat still is nigh;<br/>
It cannot from its course be driv’n,<br/>
’Tis sure to reach the port of Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sailor! lift again thine eyes,<br/>
Behold with joy and glad surprise<br/>
A glorious morn, that dawns for thee,<br/>
Far, far beyond a stormy sea.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, land of rest from toil and care,<br/>
Who would not long to enter there,<br/>
Where every throb of pain shall cease,<br/>
And every sigh be hushed to peace!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
