<br/>
Oh the joy that we may know when united here below—<br/>
We are marching to the palace of the King;<br/>
With our faith serenely bright, every burden will be light,<br/>
And together of His mercy we shall sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing the song, the happy song,<br/>
That fills with joy the realms of glory,<br/>
Sing the song, the happy song,<br/>
And praise, and praise His Name forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the rapture of the soul, tho’ the stormy billows roll,<br/>
If in Jesus we are sheltered from alarms;<br/>
We can shout aloud His praise, who directed all our ways,<br/>
For beneath us are His everlasting arms.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the tranquil peace and love that He giveth from above,<br/>
And the comfort that His sacred presence brings;<br/>
When He calls His own apart, and communes with every heart,<br/>
While we rest beneath the shadow of His wings.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When our journey here is past, and the twilight comes at last,<br/>
When the deeper shades of evening shall descend;<br/>
What a morning will be ours, in those never fading bowers,<br/>
When we join the nobler song that ne’er shall end.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
