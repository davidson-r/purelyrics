Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He is born, the holy Child,<br/>
Play the oboe and bagpipes merrily!<br/>
He is born, the holy Child,<br/>
Sing we all of the Savior mild.<br/>
<br/>
Through long ages of the past,<br/>
Prophets have foretold His coming;<br/>
Through long ages of the past,<br/>
Now the time has come at last!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O how lovely, O how pure<br/>
Is this perfect Child of heaven;<br/>
O how lovely, O how pure<br/>
Gracious gift to humankind!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Lord of all the world,<br/>
Coming as a Child among us,<br/>
Jesus, Lord of all the world,<br/>
Grant to us Thy heavenly peace.<br/>
