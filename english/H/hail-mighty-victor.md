<br/>
Hail, mighty Victor! Behold He comes from out the grave.<br/>
Shout, shout His triumph! Oh, tell abroad His power to save.<br/>
Sing, sing with gladness, proclaim the news o’er land and sea:<br/>
He reigns forever, great Ruler over all is He.<br/>
<br/>
Shout His praise, for us He came to die.<br/>
But lo, He lives!<br/>
He reigns upon His Father’s throne on high.<br/>
<br/>
Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the Lord be given.<br/>
Praise Him! all ye people, mighty Ruler of earth and Heav’n.<br/>
Praise Him! all ye stars of night.<br/>
Praise Him! all ye shining hosts of light.<br/>
Oh! that men would bless and praise His holy Name,<br/>
Would praise His holy Name.<br/>
