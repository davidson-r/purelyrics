<br/>
Hark! how time’s wide sounding bell<br/>
Strikes on each attentive ear!<br/>
Tolling loud the solemn knell<br/>
Of the late departed year:<br/>
Years, like mortals, wear away,<br/>
Have their birth, and dying day;<br/>
Youthful spring, and wintry age,<br/>
Then to others quit the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Sad experience may relate<br/>
What a year the last has been!<br/>
Crops of sorrow have been great,<br/>
From the fruitful seeds of sin:<br/>
O! what numbers gay and blithe,<br/>
Fell by death’s unsparing scythe?<br/>
While they thought the world their own,<br/>
Suddenly he mowed them down.<br/>
<br/>
See how war, with dreadful stride,<br/>
Marches at the Lord’s command,<br/>
Spreading desolation wide,<br/>
Through a once much-favored land:<br/>
War, with heart and arms of steel,<br/>
Preys on thousands at a meal;<br/>
Daily drinking human gore,<br/>
Still he thirsts, and calls for more.<br/>
<br/>
If the God, Whom we provoke,<br/>
Hither should His way direct;<br/>
What a sin-avenging stroke<br/>
May a land, like this, expect!<br/>
They who now securely sleep,<br/>
Quickly then, would wake and weep;<br/>
And too late would learn to fear,<br/>
When they saw the danger near.<br/>
<br/>
You are safe, who know His love,<br/>
He will all His truth perform;<br/>
To your souls a refuge prove<br/>
From the rage of every storm:<br/>
But we tremble for the youth;<br/>
Teach them, Lord, Thy saving truth;<br/>
Join them to Thy faithful few,<br/>
Be to them a Refuge too.<br/>
