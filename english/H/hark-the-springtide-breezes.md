Hark! the springtide breezes pass the news along,<br/>
Jesus Christ has risen, fill the world with song;<br/>
Earth and all her voices sing glad hosannas to the King,<br/>
Praises to our Lord we bring, Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory, hallelujah! Praise the victor King,<br/>
Who to all His people life and light doth bring,<br/>
Glory, hallelujah! Praise the victor King,<br/>
Who to all His people life and light doth bring.<br/>
<br/>
Finished is the conflict, all the battles o’er,<br/>
Peace that passeth knowledge comes to us once more,<br/>
Raise your notes of triumph high, Jesus lives no more to die,<br/>
Earth and Heav’n with joy reply, Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Golden gates are lifted, doors stand open wide,<br/>
Lo! the King is standing at His Father’s side,<br/>
In the land of endless light angels praise Him, day and night,<br/>
Crown Him ever Lord of might, Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
