<br/>
Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound;<br/>
My ears, attend the cry;<br/>
“Ye living men, come view the ground<br/>
Where you must shortly lie.<br/>
<br/>
“Princes, this clay must be your bed,<br/>
In spite of all your towers;<br/>
The tall, the wise, the rev’rend head<br/>
Must lie as low as ours!”<br/>
<br/>
Great God! is this our certain doom?<br/>
And are we still secure?<br/>
Still walking downward to our tomb,<br/>
And yet prepare no more?<br/>
<br/>
Grant us the powers of quick’ning grace,<br/>
To fit our souls to fly,<br/>
Then, when we drop this dying flesh,<br/>
We’ll rise above the sky.<br/>
