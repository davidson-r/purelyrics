<br/>
Hark! a thrilling voice is sounding;<br/>
“Christ is nigh,” it seems to say,<br/>
“Cast away the works of darkness,<br/>
O ye children of the day.”<br/>
<br/>
Wakened by the solemn warning<br/>
Let the earthbound soul arise;<br/>
Christ, her Sun, all ill dispelling,<br/>
Shines upon the morning skies.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, the Lamb, so long expected,<br/>
Comes with pardon down from Heav’n;<br/>
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,<br/>
One and all to be forgiven.<br/>
<br/>
That when next He comes in glory,<br/>
And the world is wrapped in fear,<br/>
With His mercy He may shield us,<br/>
And with words of love draw near.<br/>
<br/>
Honor, glory, might, and blessing<br/>
Be to God: the Father, Son<br/>
And the everlasting Spirit,<br/>
While eternal ages run.<br/>
