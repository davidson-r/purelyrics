<br/>
He has come, the Christ of God:<br/>
Left for us His glad abode;<br/>
Stooping from His throne of bliss<br/>
To this darksome wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
He has come, the Prince of Peace:<br/>
Come to bid our sorrows cease;<br/>
Come to scatter with His light<br/>
All the shadows of our night.<br/>
<br/>
He, the mighty King, has come,<br/>
Making this poor earth His home:<br/>
Come to bear our sin’s sad load,<br/>
Son of David, Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
He has come, Whose Name of grace<br/>
Speaks deliverance to our race:<br/>
Left for us His glad abode,<br/>
Son of Mary, Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
Unto us a Child is born:<br/>
Ne’er has earth beheld a morn<br/>
Among all the morns of time,<br/>
Half so glorious in its prime.<br/>
<br/>
Unto us a Son is given:<br/>
He has come from God’s own Heaven,<br/>
Bringing with Him from above<br/>
Holy peace and holy love.<br/>
