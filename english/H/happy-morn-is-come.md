<br/>
The happy morn is come!<br/>
Triumphant oâ€™er the grave,<br/>
The Lord hath left the tomb<br/>
Omnipotent to save.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Captivity is captive led;<br/>
For Jesus liveth that was dead.<br/>
<br/>
Who now accuseth them<br/>
For whom their Surety died?<br/>
Who now shall those condemn<br/>
Whom God hath justified?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Christ hath the ransom paid;<br/>
The glorious work is done;<br/>
Oh Him our help is laid;<br/>
By Him our victory won.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hail, the triumphant Lord!<br/>
Thy resurrection Thou!<br/>
We bless Thy sacred Word;<br/>
Before Thy throne we bow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
