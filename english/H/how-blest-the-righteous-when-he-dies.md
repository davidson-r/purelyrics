<br/>
How blest the righteous when he dies!<br/>
When sinks a weary soul to rest,<br/>
How mildly beam the closing eyes,<br/>
How gently heaves th’expiring breast!<br/>
<br/>
So fades a summer cloud away;<br/>
So sinks a gale when storms are o’er;<br/>
So gently shuts the eye of day;<br/>
So dies a wave along the shore.<br/>
<br/>
A holy quiet reigns around,<br/>
A calm which life nor death destroys;<br/>
And naught disturbs that peace profound<br/>
Which his unfettered soul enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,<br/>
Where lights and shades alternate dwell;<br/>
How bright th’unchanging morn appears!<br/>
Farewell, inconstant world, farewell!<br/>
<br/>
Life’s labor done, as sinks the clay,<br/>
Light from its load the spirit flies,<br/>
While Heav’n and earth combine to say,<br/>
“How blest the righteous when he dies!”<br/>
