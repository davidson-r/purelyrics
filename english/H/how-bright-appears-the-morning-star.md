<br/>
How bright appears the morning star,<br/>
With mercy beaming from afar!<br/>
The host of Heav’n rejoices!<br/>
O righteous Branch! O Jesse’s Rod!<br/>
Thou Son of man, and Son of God!<br/>
We too will lift our voices<br/>
Jesus! Jesus! Holy, holy! yet most lowly!<br/>
Draw Thou near us:<br/>
Great Emmanuel! stoop and hear us!<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice, ye heav’ns, thou earth, reply!<br/>
With praise, ye sinners, fill the sky!<br/>
For this His incarnation!<br/>
Incarnate God, put forth Thy power,<br/>
Ride on, ride on, great Conqueror,<br/>
Till all know Thy salvation.<br/>
Amen, amen! Alleluia, alleluia!<br/>
Praise be given<br/>
Evermore, by earth and Heaven.<br/>
