<br/>
How sweet the hour of closing day,<br/>
When all is peaceful and serene,<br/>
And when the sun, with cloudless ray,<br/>
Sheds mellow luster o’er the scene!<br/>
<br/>
Such is the Christian’s parting hour;<br/>
So peacefully he sinks to rest,<br/>
When faith, endued from Heav’n with power, <br/>
Sustains and cheers his languid breast.<br/>
<br/>
Mark but that radiance of his eye,<br/>
That smile upon his wasted cheek;<br/>
They tell us of his glory nigh,<br/>
In language that no tongue can speak.<br/>
<br/>
A beam from Heav’n is sent to cheer<br/>
The pilgrim on his gloomy road;<br/>
And angels are attending near,<br/>
To bear him to their bright abode.<br/>
<br/>
Who would not wish to die like those<br/>
Whom God’s own Spirit deigns to bless?<br/>
To sink into that soft repose,<br/>
Then wake to perfect happiness?<br/>
