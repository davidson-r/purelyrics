Here Comes the Bride - Wedding March<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We all know the humorous words to 'Hear comes the Bride' but the first lyrics on this page come from the <br/>
"Bridal Chorus" "Treulich gef√ºhrt", from the opera Lohengrin, by the German composer Richard Wagner. This is the famous march played for the bride's entrance at many formal Christian weddings. In English-speaking countries the Bridal Chorus is generally known as "Here Comes the Bride" or the "Wedding March". A Wedding march traditionally accompanies the entrance or exit of the bride at her wedding, most notably the "Wedding March" by Felix Mendelssohn. The alternative lyrics "Here comes the bride dressed all in light" follow and finally we have included the parody!
