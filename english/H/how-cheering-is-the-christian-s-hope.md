<br/>
How cheering is the Christianâ€™s hope,<br/>
While toiling here below!<br/>
It buoys us up while passing through<br/>
This wilderness of woe.<br/>
It buoys us up while passing through<br/>
This wilderness of woe.<br/>
<br/>
It points us to a land of rest,<br/>
Where saints with Christ will reign;<br/>
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,<br/>
And never part again.<br/>
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,<br/>
And never part again.<br/>
<br/>
Fly, lingering moments, fly, O fly;<br/>
Dear Savior, quickly come!<br/>
We long to see Thee as Thou art,<br/>
And reach that blissful shore.<br/>
We long to see Thee as Thou art,<br/>
And reach that blissful shore.<br/>
