<br/>
Once it was the blessing,<br/>
Now it is the Lord;<br/>
Once it was the feeling,<br/>
Now it is His Word;<br/>
Once His gift I wanted,<br/>
Now, the Giver own;<br/>
Once I sought for healing,<br/>
Now Himself alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All in all forever,<br/>
Jesus will I sing;<br/>
Everything in Jesus,<br/>
And Jesus everything.<br/>
<br/>
Once ’twas painful trying,<br/>
Now ’tis perfect trust;<br/>
Once a half salvation,<br/>
Now the uttermost;<br/>
Once ’twas ceaseless holding,<br/>
Now He holds me fast;<br/>
Once ’twas constant drifting,<br/>
Now my anchor’s cast.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Once ’twas busy planning,<br/>
Now ’tis trustful prayer;<br/>
Once ’twas anxious caring,<br/>
Now He has the care;<br/>
Once ’twas what I wanted,<br/>
Now what Jesus says;<br/>
Once ’twas constant asking,<br/>
Now ’tis ceaseless praise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Once it was my working,<br/>
His it hence shall be;<br/>
Once I tried to use Him,<br/>
Now He uses me;<br/>
Once the pow’r I wanted,<br/>
Now the Mighty One;<br/>
Once for self I labored,<br/>
Now for Him alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Once I hoped in Jesus,<br/>
Now I know He’s mine;<br/>
Once my lamps were dying,<br/>
Now they brightly shine;<br/>
Once for death I waited,<br/>
Now His coming hail;<br/>
And my hopes are anchored<br/>
Safe within the veil.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
