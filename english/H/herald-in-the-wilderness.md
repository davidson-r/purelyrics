<br/>
Herald, in the wilderness,<br/>
Breaking up the road,<br/>
Sinking mountains, raising plains,<br/>
For the path of God;<br/>
<br/>
Prophet, to the multitudes<br/>
Calling to repent,<br/>
In the way of righteousness<br/>
Unto Israel sent;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Messenger, God’s chosen one<br/>
Foremost to proclaim,<br/>
Proffered titles passing by,<br/>
Pointing to the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
Captive, for the word of truth<br/>
Boldly witnessing;<br/>
Then in Herod’s dungeon cave,<br/>
Faint and languishing;<br/>
<br/>
Martyr, sacrificed to sin<br/>
At that feast of shame;<br/>
As his life foreshowed the Lord,<br/>
In his death the same<br/>
<br/>
Holy Jesus, when He heard,<br/>
Went apart to pray:<br/>
Thus may we our lesson take<br/>
From his saint today.<br/>
