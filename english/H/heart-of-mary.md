<br/>
Heart of Mary, Heart all pure,<br/>
Sinless Heart of Mary!<br/>
Heart most tender, refuge sure,<br/>
Spotless Heart of Mary!<br/>
Chosen vessel undefiled,<br/>
Lily chalice holy!<br/>
Through the merits of thy Child,<br/>
Make us pure and holy. <br/>
<br/>
Temple of the Trinity, <br/>
Throne of God all holy,<br/>
Ark of His divinity,<br/>
Tabernacle holy!<br/>
Cradle of the Word divine,<br/>
Show us Christ our Brother,<br/>
Heart of Mary, mystic shrine,<br/>
Show thyself our Mother. <br/>
<br/>
Source of Christ's most precious blood,<br/>
Virgin Heart of Mary!<br/>
Cleanse us in that saving flood,<br/>
Victim Heart of Mary!<br/>
May thy love our hearts refine,<br/>
Bless our consecration;<br/>
May our heart be one with thine,<br/>
Making reparation.. <br/>
