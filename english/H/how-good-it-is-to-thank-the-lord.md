How good it is to thank the Lord,<br/>
And praise to Thee, Most High, accord,<br/>
To show Thy love with morning light,<br/>
And tell Thy faithfulness each night;<br/>
Yea, good it is Thy praise to sing,<br/>
And all our sweetest music bring.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, with joy my heart expands,<br/>
Before the wonders of Thy hands;<br/>
Great works, Jehovah, Thou hast wrought,<br/>
Exceeding deep Thine every thought;<br/>
A foolish man knows not their worth,<br/>
Nor he whose mind is of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
When as the grass the wicked grow,<br/>
When sinners flourish here below,<br/>
Then is there endless ruin nigh,<br/>
But Thou, O Lord, art throned on high;<br/>
Thy foes shall fall before Thy might,<br/>
The wicked shall be put to flight.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Lord, hast high exalted me<br/>
With royal strength and dignity;<br/>
With Thine anointing I am blest,<br/>
Thy grace and favor on me rest;<br/>
I thus exult o’er all my foes,<br/>
O’er all that would my cause oppose.<br/>
<br/>
The righteous man shall flourish well,<br/>
And in the house of God shall dwell;<br/>
He shall be like a goodly tree,<br/>
And all his life shall fruitful be;<br/>
For righteous is the Lord and just,<br/>
He is my Rock, in Him I trust.
