<center>
Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning!<br/>
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!<br/>
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning;<br/>
Zion in triumph begins her mild reign.<br/>
<br/>
Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning!<br/>
Long by the prophets of Israel foretold!<br/>
Hail to the millions from bondage returning!<br/>
Gentiles and Jews the blest vision behold.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing,<br/>
Streams ever copious are gliding along;<br/>
Loud from the mountain tops echoes are ringing,<br/>
Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.<br/>
<br/>
See, from all lands, from the isles of the ocean,<br/>
Praise to the Savior ascending on high;<br/>
Fallen the engines of war and commotion;<br/>
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
