<br/>
Walking in sunlight all of my journey;<br/>
Over the mountains, through the deep vale;<br/>
Jesus has said, “I’ll never forsake thee,”<br/>
Promise divine that never can fail.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight,<br/>
Flooding my soul with glory divine:<br/>
Hallelujah, I am rejoicing,<br/>
Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.<br/>
<br/>
Shadows around me, shadows above me,<br/>
Never conceal my Savior and Guide;<br/>
He is the Light, in Him is no darkness;<br/>
Ever I’m walking close to His side.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing,<br/>
Pressing my way to mansions above;<br/>
Singing His praises gladly I’m walking,<br/>
Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
