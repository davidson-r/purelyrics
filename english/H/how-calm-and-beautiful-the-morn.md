How calm and beautiful the morn<br/>
That gilds the sacred tomb,<br/>
Where Christ the Crucified was borne,<br/>
And veiled in midnight gloom!<br/>
O weep no more the Savior slain;<br/>
The Lord is risen; He lives again.<br/>
<br/>
Ye mourning saints, dry every tear<br/>
For your departed Lord;<br/>
Behold the place, He is not here,<br/>
The tomb is all unbarred;<br/>
The gates of death were closed in vain:<br/>
The Lord is risen; He lives again.<br/>
<br/>
Now cheerful to the house of prayer<br/>
Your early footsteps bend;<br/>
The Savior will Himself be there,<br/>
Your Advocate and Friend:<br/>
Once by the law your hopes were slain,<br/>
But now in Christ ye live again.<br/>
<br/>
How tranquil now the rising day!<br/>
’Tis Jesus still appears,<br/>
A risen Lord to chase away<br/>
Your unbelieving fears:<br/>
O weep no more your comforts slain;<br/>
The Lord is risen; He lives again.<br/>
<br/>
And when the shades of evening fall,<br/>
When life’s last hour draws nigh,<br/>
If Jesus shine upon the soul,<br/>
How blissful then to die!<br/>
Since He has risen that once was slain,<br/>
Ye die in Christ to live again.
