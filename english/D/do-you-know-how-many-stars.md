Do you know how many stars<br/>
There are shining in the sky?<br/>
Do you know how many clouds<br/>
Every day go floating by?<br/>
God, the Lord, their number knoweth,<br/>
For each one His care He showeth,<br/>
Of the bright and boundless host,<br/>
Of the bright and boundless host.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how many birdies<br/>
In the sunshine sing each day?<br/>
Do you know how many fishes<br/>
In the sparkling water play?<br/>
God, the Lord, Who dwells in Heaven,<br/>
Name and life to each has given,<br/>
In His love they live and move,<br/>
In His love they live and move.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how many children<br/>
Go to little beds at night,<br/>
And without a care or sorrow<br/>
Wake again with morning light?<br/>
God in Heav’n each name can tell,<br/>
Know us, too, and loves us well,<br/>
He’s our best and dearest Friend,<br/>
He’s our best and dearest Friend.<br/>
