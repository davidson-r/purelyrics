title: Dawn Is Sprinkling In The East

<br/>
The dawn is sprinkling in the east<br/>
Its golden shower, as day flows in;<br/>
Fast mount the pointed shafts of light:<br/>
Farewell to darkness and to sin!<br/>
<br/>
Away, ye midnight phantoms all!<br/>
Away, despondence and despair!<br/>
Whatever guilt the night has brought<br/>
Now let it vanish into air.<br/>
<br/>
So, Lord, when that last morning breaks,<br/>
Looking to which we sigh and pray,<br/>
O may it to Thy minstrels prove<br/>
The dawning of a better day.<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father glory be,<br/>
And to His sole begotten Son;<br/>
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to Thee<br/>
While everlasting ages run.<br/>
