<br/>
Draw nigh and take the Body of the Lord,<br/>
and drink the holy Blood for you outpoured.<br/>
<br/>
Saved by that Body and that precious Blood,<br/>
with souls refreshed, we render thanks to God.<br/>
<br/>
Salvation's Giver, Christ, the only Son,<br/>
by his dear Cross and Blood the victory won.<br/>
<br/>
Offered was he for greatest and for least,<br/>
himself the Victim, and himself the Priest.<br/>
<br/>
Victims were offered by the law of old,<br/>
which in a type this heavenly mystery foretold.<br/>
<br/>
He, Ransomer, from death, and Light from shade,<br/>
now gives his holy grace his saints to aid;<br/>
<br/>
approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,<br/>
and take the safeguard of salvation here.<br/>
<br/>
He that in this world rules his saints and shields,<br/>
to all believers life eternal yields.<br/>
<br/>
With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,<br/>
gives living waters to the thirsting soul.<br/>
<br/>
Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow<br/>
all nations at the Doom, is with us now. <br/>
