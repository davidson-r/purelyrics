<br/>
Dark is the night, and cold the wind is blowing,<br/>
Nearer and nearer comes the breakers’ roar;<br/>
Where shall I go, or whither fly for refuge?<br/>
Hide me, my Father, till the storm is o’er.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With His loving hand to guide, let the clouds above me roll,<br/>
And the billows in their fury dash around me.<br/>
I can brave the wildest storm, with His glory in my soul,<br/>
I can sing amidst the tempest—Praise the Lord!<br/>
<br/>
Dark is the night, but cheering is the promise,<br/>
He will go with me o’er the troubled wave;<br/>
Safe He will lead me through the pathless waters,<br/>
Jesus, the mighty One, and strong to save.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Dark is the night, but lo! the day is breaking,<br/>
Onward my bark, unfurl thy every sail,<br/>
Now at the helm I see my Father standing,<br/>
Soon will my anchor drop within the veil.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
