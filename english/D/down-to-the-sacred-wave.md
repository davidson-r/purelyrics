title: Down To The Sacred Wave

<center>
<br/>
Down to the sacred wave,<br/>
The Lord of life was led;<br/>
And He Who came our souls to save<br/>
In Jordan bowed His head.<br/>
<br/>
He taught the solemn way;<br/>
He fixed the holy rite;<br/>
He bade His ransomed ones obey,<br/>
And keep the path of light.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Savior, we will tread<br/>
In Thy appointed way;<br/>
Let glory oâ€™er these scenes be shed<br/>
And smile on us today.<br/>

</center>
