Dear Christian people all, rejoice,<br/>
Each soul with joy upraising.<br/>
Pour forth a song with heart and voice,<br/>
With love and gladness singing.<br/>
Give thanks to God, our Lord above,<br/>
Thanks for His miracle of love!<br/>
Dearly He hath redeemed us.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke to His belovèd Son<br/>
With infinite compassion:<br/>
“Go hence, my heart’s most precious One,<br/>
Be to the lost Salvation;<br/>
Death, his relentless tyrant, stay,<br/>
And bear him from his sins away<br/>
With Thee to live forever!”<br/>
<br/>
The Son came, saying: “Cling to Me,<br/>
Thy sorrows now are ending;<br/>
Freely I give Myself to thee,<br/>
Thy life with Mine defending;<br/>
For I am thine and thou art Mine,<br/>
And where I am there thou shalt shine,<br/>
The foe shall never reach us.”<br/>
<br/>
“To heaven again I rise from hence,<br/>
High to my Father soaring,<br/>
The Master there to be, and thence<br/>
My Spirit on thee pouring;<br/>
In every grief to comfort thee,<br/>
And teach thee more and more of Me,<br/>
Into all truth still guiding.”<br/>
<br/>
“What I have done and taught on earth,<br/>
Do Thou, and teach, none dreading;<br/>
That so God’s kingdom may go forth,<br/>
And His high praise be spreading;<br/>
And guard thee from the words of men,<br/>
Lest the great joy be lost again:<br/>
This my last charge I leave thee.”
