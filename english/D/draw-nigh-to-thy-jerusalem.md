title: Draw Nigh To Thy Jerusalem

<br/>
Draw nigh to Thy Jerusalem, O Lord,<br/>
Thy faithful people cry with one accord;<br/>
Ride on in triumph; Lord, behold we lay<br/>
Our passions, lusts, and proud wills in Thy way!<br/>
<br/>
Thy road is ready; and Thy paths made straight,<br/>
With longing expectation seem to wait<br/>
The consecration of Thy beauteous feet,<br/>
And silently Thy promised advent greet!<br/>
<br/>
Hosanna! welcome to our hearts! for here<br/>
Thou hast a temple, too, as Zion dear;<br/>
O enter in, dear Lord, unbar the door;<br/>
And in that temple dwell forevermore.<br/>
