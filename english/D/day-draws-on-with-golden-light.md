title: Day Draws On With Golden Light

<center>
The day draws on with golden light,<br/>
Glad songs go echoing through the height,<br/>
The broad earth lifts an answering cheer,<br/>
The deep makes moan with wailing fear.<br/>
<br/>
For lo, He comes, the mighty King,<br/>
To take from death his power and sting,<br/>
To trample down his gloomy reign<br/>
And break the weary prisoner’s chain.<br/>
<br/>
Enclosed He lay in rocky cell,<br/>
With guard of armèd sentinel;<br/>
But thence returning, strong and free,<br/>
He comes with pomp of jubilee.<br/>
<br/>
The sad Apostles mourn Him slain,<br/>
Nor hope to see their Lord again;<br/>
Their Lord, Whom rebel thralls defy,<br/>
Arraign, accuse, and doom to die.<br/>
<br/>
But now they put their grief away,<br/>
The pains of hell are loosed today;<br/>
For by the grave, with flashing eyes,<br/>
“Your Lord is risen,” the angel cries.<br/>
<br/>
Maker of all, to Thee we pray,<br/>
Fulfill in us Thy joy today;<br/>
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we<br/>
May share Thy Paschal victory.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee Who, dead, again, dost live,<br/>
All glory, Lord, Thy people give;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To Father and to Paraclete.
