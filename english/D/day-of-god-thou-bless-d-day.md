<center>
Day of God, thou bless√®d day,<br/>
At thy dawn the grave gave way<br/>
To the power of Him within,<br/>
Who had, sinless, bled for sin.<br/>
<br/>
Thine the radiance to illume<br/>
First, for man, the dismal tomb,<br/>
When its bars their weakness owned,<br/>
There revealing death dethroned.<br/>
<br/>
Then the Sun of righteousness<br/>
Rose, a darkened world to bless,<br/>
Bringing up from mortal night<br/>
Immortality and light.<br/>
<br/>
Day of glory, day of power,<br/>
Sacred be thine every hour:<br/>
Emblem, earnest, of the rest<br/>
That remaineth for the blest.
