title: Death Is Only a Dream

<center>
<br/>
Sadly we sing, and with tremulous breath,<br/>
As we stand by the mystical stream,<br/>
In the valley and by the dark river of death,<br/>
And yet ’tis no more than a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Only a dream, only a dream,<br/>
And glory beyond the dark stream;<br/>
How peaceful the slumber,<br/>
How happy the waking;<br/>
For death is only a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Why should we weep when the weary ones rest<br/>
In the bosom of Jesus supreme,<br/>
In the mansions of glory prepared for the blest?<br/>
For death is no more than a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Naught in the river the saints should appall,<br/>
Tho’ it frightfully dismal may seem;<br/>
In the arms of their Savior no ill can befall,<br/>
They find it no more than a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Over the turbid and onrushing tide<br/>
Doth the light of eternity gleam;<br/>
And the ransomed the darkness and storm shall outride,<br/>
To wake with glad smiles from their dream.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
