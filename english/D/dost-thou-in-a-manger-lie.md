Dost Thou in a manger lie, Who hast all created,<br/>
Stretching infant hands on high, Savior, long awaited?<br/>
If a monarch, where Thy state? Where Thy court on Thee to wait?<br/>
Royal purple where? Here no regal pomp we see;<br/>
Naught but need and penury; why thus cradled here?<br/>
<br/>
“Pitying love for fallen man brought Me down thus low…<br/>
For a race deep lost in sin, came I into woe…<br/>
By this lowly birth of Mine, sinner riches shall be thine,<br/>
Matchless gifts and free; willingly this yoke I take,<br/>
And this sacrifice I make, heaping joys for thee.”<br/>
<br/>
Fervent praise would I to Thee evermore be raising;<br/>
For Thy wondrous love to me Thee be ever praising.<br/>
Glory, glory be forever unto that most bounteous Giver,<br/>
And that loving Lord! Better witness to Thy worth,<br/>
Purer praise than ours on earth, angels’ songs afford.
