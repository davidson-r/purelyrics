<br/>
Down from the worlds of radiant light<br/>
Behold the Savior come,<br/>
To ransom souls from endless night<br/>
And bring the wand’rers home.<br/>
<br/>
He calls us to His dear embrace<br/>
From mis’ry and despair,<br/>
Bids us receive His wondrous grace,<br/>
And seek salvation there.<br/>
<br/>
We come, Emmanuel, at Thy call,<br/>
Believe Thy glad’ning Word,<br/>
Renounce our sins, ourselves, our all,<br/>
And glory in our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Salvation to Messiah’s Name<br/>
With grateful hearts we sing,<br/>
And join our voices to proclaim<br/>
Our Saviour and our King.<br/>
<br/>
Immortal praise to God belongs<br/>
For such unfathomed love;<br/>
Join, all below, in rapturous songs,<br/>
And shout, ye hosts above.<br/>
