title: Do No Sinful Action

<br/>
Do no sinful action,<br/>
Speak no angry word;<br/>
Ye belong to Jesus,<br/>
Children of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Christ is kind and gentle,<br/>
Christ is pure and true;<br/>
And His little children<br/>
Must be holy, too.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a wicked spirit<br/>
Watching round you still,<br/>
And he tries to tempt you<br/>
To all harm and ill.<br/>
<br/>
But ye must not hear him,<br/>
Though ’tis hard for you<br/>
To resist the evil,<br/>
And the good to do.<br/>
<br/>
For ye promised truly,<br/>
In your infant days,<br/>
To renounce him wholly,<br/>
And forsake his ways.<br/>
<br/>
Ye are newborn Christians,<br/>
Ye must learn to fight<br/>
With the bad within you,<br/>
And to do the right.<br/>
<br/>
Christ is your own Master,<br/>
He is good and true,<br/>
And His little children<br/>
Must be holy, too.<br/>
