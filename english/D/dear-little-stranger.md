Low in a manger, dear little Stranger,<br/>
Jesus, the wonderful Savior, was born.<br/>
There was none to receive Him, none to believe Him,<br/>
None but the angels were watching that morn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Dear little Stranger, slept in a manger,<br/>
No downy pillow under His head;<br/>
But with the poor He slumbered secure,<br/>
The dear little Babe in His bed.<br/>
<br/>
Angels descending, over Him bending,<br/>
Chanted a tender and silent refrain;<br/>
Then a wonderful story told of His glory,<br/>
Unto the shepherds on Bethlehemâ€™s plain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Dear little Stranger, born in a manger,<br/>
Maker and Monarch, and Savior of all;<br/>
I will love You forever! Grieve You? No, never!<br/>
You did for me make Your bed in a stall.<br/>
<br/>
