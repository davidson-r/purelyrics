<br/>
The day of resurrection! Earth, tell it out abroad;<br/>
The Passover of gladness, the Passover of God.<br/>
From death to life eternal, from earth unto the sky,<br/>
Our Christ hath brought us over, with hymns of victory.<br/>
<br/>
Our hearts be pure from evil, that we may see aright<br/>
The Lord in rays eternal of resurrection light;<br/>
And listening to His accents, may hear, so calm and plain,<br/>
His own “All hail!” and, hearing, may raise the victor strain.<br/>
<br/>
Now let the heavens be joyful! Let earth the song begin!<br/>
Let the round world keep triumph, and all that is therein!<br/>
Let all things seen and unseen their notes in gladness blend,<br/>
For Christ the Lord hath risen, our joy that hath no end.<br/>
