title: Dust To Dust the Mortal Dies

<center>
Dust to dust, the mortal dies,<br/>
Both the foolish and the wise;<br/>
None forever can remain,<br/>
Each must leave his hoarded gain.<br/>
Yet within their heart they say<br/>
That their houses are for aye,<br/>
That their dwelling places grand<br/>
Shall for generations stand.<br/>
<br/>
To their lands they give their name<br/>
In the hope of lasting fame,<br/>
But man’s honor quickly flies,<br/>
Like the lowly beast he dies.<br/>
Though such folly mark their way,<br/>
Men approve of what they say;<br/>
Death their shepherd, they the sheep,<br/>
He within his fold will keep.<br/>
<br/>
O’er them soon shall rule the just,<br/>
All their beauty turn to dust;<br/>
God my waiting soul shall save,<br/>
He will raise me from the grave.<br/>
Let no fear disturb your peace<br/>
Though one’s house and wealth increase;<br/>
Death shall end his fleeting day,<br/>
He shall carry naught away.<br/>
<br/>
Though in life he wealth attained,<br/>
Though the praise of men he gained,<br/>
He shall join those gone before,<br/>
Where the light shall shine no more.<br/>
Crowned with honor though he be,<br/>
Highly gifted, strong and free,<br/>
If he be not truly wise,<br/>
Man is like the beast that dies.
