<br/>
Depth of mercy! Can there be<br/>
Mercy still reserved for me?<br/>
Can my God His wrath forbear,<br/>
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?<br/>
<br/>
I have long withstood His grace,<br/>
Long provoked Him to His face,<br/>
Would not hearken to His calls,<br/>
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.<br/>
<br/>
I my Master have denied,<br/>
I afresh have crucified,<br/>
And profaned His hallowed Name,<br/>
Put Him to an open shame.<br/>
<br/>
I have spilt His precious blood,<br/>
Trampled on the Son of God,<br/>
Filled with pangs unspeakable,<br/>
I, who yet am not in hell!<br/>
<br/>
Lo! I still walk on the ground:<br/>
Lo! an Advocate is found:<br/>
“Hasten not to cut him down,<br/>
Let this barren soul alone.”<br/>
<br/>
Jesus speaks, and pleads His blood!<br/>
He disarms the wrath of God;<br/>
Now my Father’s mercies move,<br/>
Justice lingers into love.<br/>
<br/>
Kindled His relentings are,<br/>
Me He now delights to spare,<br/>
Cries, “How shall I give thee up?”<br/>
Lets the lifted thunder drop.<br/>
<br/>
Whence to me this waste of love?<br/>
Ask my Advocate above!<br/>
See the cause in Jesus’ face,<br/>
Now before the throne of grace.<br/>
<br/>
There for me the Savior stands,<br/>
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands.<br/>
God is love! I know, I feel;<br/>
Jesus weeps and loves me still.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, answer from above,<br/>
Is not all Thy nature love?<br/>
Wilt Thou not the wrong forget,<br/>
Permit me to kiss Thy feet?<br/>
<br/>
If I rightly read Thy heart,<br/>
If Thou all compassion art,<br/>
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,<br/>
Pardon and accept me now.<br/>
<br/>
Pity from Thine eye let fall,<br/>
By a look my soul recall;<br/>
Now the stone to flesh convert,<br/>
Cast a look, and break my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Now incline me to repent,<br/>
Let me now my sins lament,<br/>
Now my foul revolt deplore,<br/>
Weep, believe, and sin no more.<br/>
