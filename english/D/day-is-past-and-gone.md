title: Day Is Past And Gone

<center>
<br/>
The day is past and gone,<br/>
The evening shades appear;<br/>
O may we all remember well<br/>
The night of death draws near.<br/>
<br/>
We lay our garments by,<br/>
Upon our beds to rest;<br/>
So death shall soon disrobe us all<br/>
Of what is here possessed.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, keep us safe this night,<br/>
Secure from all our fears;<br/>
May angels guard us while we sleep,<br/>
Till morning light appears.<br/>
