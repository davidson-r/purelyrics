Dear Lord and Father of mankind,<br/>
Forgive our foolish ways!<br/>
Re-clothe us in our rightful mind,<br/>
In purer lives thy service find,<br/>
In deeper reverence praise.<br/>
<br/>
In simple trust like theirs who heard,<br/>
Beside the Syrian sea,<br/>
The gracious calling of the Lord,<br/>
Let us, like them, without a word<br/>
Rise up and follow thee.<br/>
<br/>
O Sabbath rest by Galilee!<br/>
O calm of hills above,<br/>
Where Jesus knelt to share with thee<br/>
The silence of eternity,<br/>
Interpreted by love!<br/>
<br/>
Drop thy still dews of quietness,<br/>
Till all our strivings cease;<br/>
Take from our souls the strain and stress,<br/>
And let our ordered lives confess<br/>
The beauty of thy peace.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe through the heats of our desire<br/>
Thy coolness and thy balm;<br/>
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;<br/>
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,<br/>
O still small voice of calm!
