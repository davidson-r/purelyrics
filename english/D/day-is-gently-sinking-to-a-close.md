The day is gently sinking to a close,<br/>
Fainter and yet more faint the sunlight glows:<br/>
O Brightness of Thy Father’s glory,<br/>
Thou eternal Light of light, be with us now:<br/>
Where Thou art present darkness cannot be;<br/>
Midnight is glorious noon, O Lord, with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Our changeful lives are ebbing to an end;<br/>
Onward to darkness and to death we tend;<br/>
O Conqueror of the grave, be Thou our Guide;<br/>
Be Thou our Light in death’s dark eventide;<br/>
Then in our mortal hour will be no gloom,<br/>
No sting in death, no terror in the tomb.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Who in darkness walking didst appear<br/>
Upon the waves, and Thy disciples cheer,<br/>
Come, Lord, in lonesome days, when storms assail,<br/>
And earthly hopes and human succors fail;<br/>
When all is dark, may we behold Thee nigh,<br/>
And hear Thy voice, “Fear not, for it is I.”<br/>
<br/>
The weary world is moldering to decay,<br/>
Its glories wane, its pageants fade away:<br/>
In that last sunset, when the stars shall fall,<br/>
May we arise, awakened by Thy call,<br/>
With Thee, O Lord, forever to abide,<br/>
In that blest day which has no eventide.
