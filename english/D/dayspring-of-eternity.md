<br/>
Dayspring of eternity!<br/>
Hide no more Thy radiant dawning!<br/>
Light from light’s exhaustless sea,<br/>
Shine on us afresh this morning!<br/>
And dispel with glorious might<br/>
All our night.<br/>
<br/>
Let Thy mercies’ morning dew<br/>
Rouse our conscience from its blindness:<br/>
Gladden life’s dry plains anew<br/>
With the rivers of Thy kindness;<br/>
Water daily us Thy flock<br/>
From the rock.<br/>
<br/>
Let the glow of love destroy<br/>
Cold obedience faintly given,<br/>
Wake our hearts to love and joy<br/>
With the flushing eastern heaven;<br/>
Let us truly rise ere yet<br/>
Life hath set.<br/>
<br/>
Through this dark and tearful place<br/>
Never be Thy light denied us.<br/>
O Thou glorious Sun of grace,<br/>
To yon world of gladness guide us,<br/>
When to joys that never end<br/>
We ascend!<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Thou Dayspring from on high<br/>
Grant that at Thy next appearing<br/>
We who in the graves do lie<br/>
May arise, Thy summons hearing,<br/>
And rejoice in our new life,<br/>
Far from strife.<br/>
<br/>
Light us to those heavenly spheres,<br/>
Sun of grace, in glory shrouded;<br/>
Lead us through this vale of tears<br/>
To the land whose days unclouded,<br/>
Purest joy, and perfect peace<br/>
Never cease.<br/>
