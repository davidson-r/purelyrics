<br/>
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;<br/>
Living with Jesus, a new life divine;<br/>
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,<br/>
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;<br/>
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;<br/>
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;<br/>
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Never a trial that He is not there,<br/>
Never a burden that He doth not bear,<br/>
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,<br/>
Moment by moment, I’m under His care.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Never a heartache, and never a groan,<br/>
Never a teardrop and never a moan;<br/>
Never a danger but there on the throne,<br/>
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,<br/>
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;<br/>
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,<br/>
Jesus my Savior, abides with me still.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
