<center>
Dear Master, in Thy way<br/>
Our willing feet shall tread;<br/>
What joy Thy mandate to obey,<br/>
Our great and glorious Head.<br/>
<br/>
The closing waters hid<br/>
Our former world, and we,<br/>
Seeking through death our Savior’s side,<br/>
Rejoice to die with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
And as we rise again,<br/>
Be this confession giv’n,<br/>
That we have ris’n with Christ to reign<br/>
The Lord of earth and Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
So would we die to live,<br/>
And live no more to die;<br/>
Our risen lives, O Christ, receive<br/>
And seal them in the sky.
</center>
