<br/>
Daily, daily sing to Mary,<br/>
Sing, my soul, her praises due:<br/>
All her feasts, her actions honor<br/>
With the heart's devotion true.<br/>
<br/>
Lost in wond'ring contemplation,<br/>
Be her majesty confessed:<br/>
Call her Mother, call her Virgin,<br/>
Happy Mother, Virgin blest. <br/>
<br/>
She is mighty in her pleading,<br/>
Tender in her loving care;<br/>
Ever watchful, understanding,<br/>
All our sorrows she will share.<br/>
<br/>
Advocate and loving mother,<br/>
Mediatrix of all grace:<br/>
Heaven's blessings she dispenses<br/>
On our sinful human race. <br/>
<br/>
All our graces flow through Mary;<br/>
All then join her praise to sing:<br/>
Fairest work of all creation,<br/>
Mother of creation's King.<br/>
<br/>
Sing in songs of peace unending,<br/>
Call upon her lovingly:<br/>
Seat of wisdom, Gate of heaven,<br/>
Morning star upon the sea.. <br/>
