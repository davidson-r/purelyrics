Days and moments quickly flying<br/>
Blend the living with the dead;<br/>
Soon our bodies will be lying<br/>
Each within its narrow bed.<br/>
<br/>
Soon our souls to God Who gave them<br/>
Will have sped their rapid flight:<br/>
Able now by grace to save them,<br/>
O that, while we can, we might!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, infinite Redeemer,<br/>
Maker of this mighty frame,<br/>
Teach, O teach us to remember<br/>
What we are, and whence we came.<br/>
<br/>
Whence we came and whither wending,<br/>
Soon we must through darkness go,<br/>
To inherit bliss unending,<br/>
Or eternity of woe.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, merciful Redeemer,<br/>
Rouse dead souls to hear Thy voice;<br/>
Wake, O wake each idle dreamer<br/>
Now to make the eternal choice.<br/>
<br/>
Soon before the Judge all glorious<br/>
We with all the dead shall stand:<br/>
Savior, over death victorious,<br/>
Place us then on Thy right hand.
