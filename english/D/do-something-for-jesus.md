<br/>
O brother, do something for Jesus,<br/>
Do something, my brother, today;<br/>
Go tell how He died for the sinner,<br/>
And save them from sin’s rugged way.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O brother, do something for Jesus,<br/>
Do something for Jesus today,<br/>
Be faithful to Him, life’s battles to win,<br/>
Do something for Jesus today.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, do something for Jesus,<br/>
O while not the moments away,<br/>
The Savior is tenderly calling,<br/>
Enlist in His service today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O brother, it pays to serve Jesus,<br/>
It pays to serve Him every day,<br/>
In Him there is strength for the weary,<br/>
And mercy sufficient alway.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
