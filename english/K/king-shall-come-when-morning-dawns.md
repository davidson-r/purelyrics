<br/>
The King shall come when morning dawns,<br/>
And light triumphant breaks;<br/>
When beauty gilds the eastern hills,<br/>
And life to joy awakes.<br/>
<br/>
Not as of old a little child<br/>
To bear, and fight, and die,<br/>
But crowned with glory like the sun<br/>
That lights the morning sky.<br/>
<br/>
O brighter than the rising morn<br/>
When He, victorious, rose,<br/>
And left the lonesome place of death,<br/>
Despite the rage of foes.<br/>
<br/>
O brighter than that glorious morn<br/>
Shall this fair morning be,<br/>
When Christ, our King, in beauty comes,<br/>
And we His face shall see.<br/>
<br/>
The King shall come when morning dawns,<br/>
And earthâ€™s dark night is past;<br/>
O haste the rising of that morn,<br/>
The day that aye shall last.<br/>
<br/>
And let the endless bliss begin,<br/>
By weary saints foretold,<br/>
When right shall triumph over wrong,<br/>
And truth shall be extolled.<br/>
<br/>
The King shall come when morning dawns,<br/>
And light and beauty brings:<br/>
Hail, Christ the Lord! Thy people pray,<br/>
Come quickly, King of kings.<br/>
