Keep on praying to God on high,<br/>
Keep on praying, He hears your cry;<br/>
God will answer the sincere heart,<br/>
Keep on praying, He will do His part.<br/>
<br/>

For Jesus hears you,<br/>
He’s list’ning, list’ning to your plea,<br/>
So keep on praying,<br/>
And He will answer thee.<br/>
<br/>

Keep on praying when bowed with sin,<br/>
Keep on praying and you will win;<br/>
Jesus suffered on Calvary,<br/>
Keep on praying, He will answer thee.<br/>
<br/>

Keep on praying, you’ll grow in grace,<br/>
Keep on praying and win the race;<br/>
Jesus loves you, His Word is true,<br/>
Keep on praying, He will answer you.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep on praying, He’s ever near,<br/>
Keep on praying, ’twill banish fear;<br/>
“Thro’ the valley” He’ll walk with thee;<br/>
Guide thy footsteps to eternity.<br/>
<br/>

Keep on praying all through the strife,<br/>
Prayer will purchase a crown of life;<br/>
Heav’n is ringing with songs above;<br/>
Hallelujahs, for a Savior’s love!<br/>
