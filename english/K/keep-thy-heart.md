title: Keep thy heart

---
<center>
Keep thy heart with earnest effort,<br/>
To thy God thy ear incline;<br/>
Put away all foolish longings,<br/>
Waiting for His will divine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep thy heart—with fervent watching;<br/>
Cleanse its courts with loving care—<br/>
Face to face in sweet communion,<br/>
Thou shalt meet thy Savior there.<br/>
<br/>
Keep thy heart—thou shalt not stumble<br/>
In the path of truth and light<br/>
If with firm and earnest purpose<br/>
Thou shalt keep thy heart aright.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep thy heart—dare not to enter<br/>
In the broad but downward way;<br/>
Thine the narrow path that shineth<br/>
Brighter to the perfect day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep thy heart—thy Father seeth<br/>
All that is to men unknown;<br/>
Surely in the day of sentence<br/>
He shall claim thee for His own.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
