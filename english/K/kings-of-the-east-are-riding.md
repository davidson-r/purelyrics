<br/>
The kings of the east are riding<br/>
Tonight to Bethlehem;<br/>
The sunset glows dividing,<br/>
The kings of the east are riding,<br/>
A star their journey guiding,<br/>
Gleaming with gold and gem.<br/>
The kings of the east are riding<br/>
Tonight to Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
To a strange sweet song of Zion<br/>
The starry host troops forth:<br/>
The golden glaived Orion<br/>
To a strange sweet song of Zion,<br/>
The Archer and the Lion,<br/>
The watchers of the north:<br/>
To a strange sweet song of Zion<br/>
The starry host troops forth.<br/>
<br/>
There beams above a manger<br/>
The child face of a star;<br/>
Amid the stars a stranger,<br/>
It beams above a manger,<br/>
What means this ether ranger<br/>
To pause where poor folk are?<br/>
There beams above a manger<br/>
The child face of a star.<br/>
