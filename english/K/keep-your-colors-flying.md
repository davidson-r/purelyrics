Keep your colors flying,<br/>
All ye Christian youth,<br/>
To Christ’s call replying,<br/>
Full of grace and truth.<br/>
Rise in strength and beauty,<br/>
In life’s morning glow,<br/>
Answer to each duty,<br/>
Onward, upward go.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep your colors flying,<br/>
Stand for God and truth,<br/>
Keep your colors flying,<br/>
All ye Christian youth.<br/>
<br/>
Life is all before you<br/>
Where to choose your way,<br/>
Keep Christ’s colors o’er you;<br/>
Watch and fight and pray,<br/>
With a firm endeavor,<br/>
Ev’ry foe defy,<br/>
True to Jesus ever,<br/>
Lift your colors high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep your colors flying,<br/>
Never think of ease;<br/>
Sin and self denying,<br/>
Jesus only please.<br/>
Not for worldly pleasure,<br/>
Not for worldly fame,<br/>
Not for heaps of treasure,<br/>
Live for Jesus’ Name!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep your colors flying,<br/>
Walk as Jesus did;<br/>
In Him living, dying,<br/>
Let your life be hid;<br/>
Hoping, trusting, ever,<br/>
Breathe this mortal breath;<br/>
You shall live forever,<br/>
Christ has conquered death.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
