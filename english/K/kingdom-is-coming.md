<center>
<br/>
From all the dark places of earth’s heathen races,<br/>
O see how the thick shadows fly!<br/>
The voice of salvation awakes every nation,<br/>
Come over and help us, they cry.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The kingdom is coming, O tell ye the story,<br/>
God’s banner exalted shall be!<br/>
The earth shall be full of His knowledge and glory,<br/>
As waters that cover the sea.<br/>
<br/>
The sunlight is glancing o’er armies advancing<br/>
To conquer the kingdoms of sin;<br/>
Our Lord shall possess them,<br/>
His presence shall bless them,<br/>
His beauty shall enter them in.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With shouting and singing, and jubilant ringing,<br/>
Their arms of rebellion cast down;<br/>
At last every nation the Lord of salvation<br/>
Their King and Redeemer shall crown!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
