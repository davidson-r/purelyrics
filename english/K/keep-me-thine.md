<br/>
Teach my little hands and feet,<br/>
Useful, Lord, to be,<br/>
Tell me something I can do—<br/>
Every day for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Keep me Thine, keep me Thine,<br/>
Blessèd Savior, keep me Thine.<br/>
Keep me Thine, keep me Thine,<br/>
Blessèd Savior, keep me Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Teach my tongue a word to speak,<br/>
Gentle, soft and low,<br/>
Make me like a beam of light<br/>
Everywhere I go.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Teach me how to love Thy Word,<br/>
Love it more and more;<br/>
Help me Lord, to work for Thee,<br/>
Till my life is o’er.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
