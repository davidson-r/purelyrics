King of saints, to Whom the number<br/>
Of Thy starry host is known,<br/>
Many a name, by man forgotten,<br/>
Lives forever round Thy throne;<br/>
Lights, which earth-born mists have darkened,<br/>
There are shining full and clear,<br/>
Princes in the court of Heaven,<br/>
Nameless, unremembered here.<br/>
<br/>
In the roll of Thine apostles<br/>
One there stands, Bartholomew,<br/>
He for whom today we offer,<br/>
Year by year, our praises due;<br/>
How he toiled for Thee and suffered<br/>
None on earth can now record;<br/>
All his saintly life is hidden<br/>
In the knowledge of his Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Was it he, beneath the fig tree<br/>
Seen of Thee, and guileless found;<br/>
He who saw the good he longed for<br/>
Rise from Nazareth’s barren ground;<br/>
He who met his risen Master<br/>
On the shore of Galilee;<br/>
He to whom the word was spoken,<br/>
“Greater things thou yet shall see”?<br/>
<br/>
None can tell us; all is written<br/>
In the Lamb’s great book of life,<br/>
All the faith, and prayer, and patience,<br/>
All the toiling, and the strife;<br/>
There are told Thy hidden treasures;<br/>
Number us, O Lord, with them,<br/>
When Thou makest up the jewels<br/>
Of Thy living diadem.
