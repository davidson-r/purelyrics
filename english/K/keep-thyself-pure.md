<br/>
Keep thyself pure! Christ’s soldier, hear,<br/>
Through life’s loud strife, the calls rings clear.<br/>
Thy Captain speaks: His word obey;<br/>
So shall thy strength be as thy day.<br/>
<br/>
Keep thyself pure! Thrice blessèd he<br/>
Whose heart from taint of sin is free;<br/>
His feet shall stand where saints have trod,<br/>
He with rapt eyes shall see his God.<br/>
<br/>
Keep thyself pure! For He Who died,<br/>
Himself for thy sake sanctified;<br/>
Then hear Him speaking from the skies,<br/>
And victor o’er temptation rise.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Spirit, keep us pure,<br/>
Grant us Thy strength when sins allure;<br/>
Our bodies are Thy temple, Lord;<br/>
Be Thou in thought and act adored.<br/>
