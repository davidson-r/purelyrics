O kings from eastern shore,<br/>
Why speed ye on your way?<br/>
What have ye gained of lore,<br/>
Ye rest not night nor day?<br/>
“The heav’nly sign have we<br/>
Read o’er with eager eye,<br/>
And written there we see<br/>
The King of kings is nigh!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Kings of the Orient, hither ye come!<br/>
Out of the darksome East, is that your home?<br/>
Tidings most wonderful to us ye bring!<br/>
Welcome, welcome, welcome we sing!<br/>
<br/>
The trappings of your steeds,<br/>
The splendor of your state,<br/>
The Star that onward leads,<br/>
Tell of a purpose great!<br/>
“Jehovah gave a sign,<br/>
And us with wisdom blessed,<br/>
And while yon light shall shine,<br/>
Our journey’s t’ward the west!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Why bear ye in your hands,<br/>
Yon gold and spice and gem?<br/>
Why haste from distant lands,<br/>
T’ward little Bethlehem?<br/>
“The mystic scroll proclaims<br/>
The Star as Judah’s own,<br/>
And David’s city names,<br/>
Where He shall set His throne!”<br/>
<br/>
