O thank the Lord, the Lord of love;<br/>
O thank the God all gods above;<br/>
O thank the mighty King of kings,<br/>
Whose arm hath done such wondrous things.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
King of kings forever and ever;<br/>
Lord of lords, forever and ever,<br/>
King of kings forever and ever;<br/>
King of kings and Lord of lords!<br/>
<br/>
Give thanks to God, for good is He,<br/>
Thanks to the God of gods give ye;<br/>
Thanks give the Lord of lords unto,<br/>
Who only wonders great can do.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>

Who thought on us amidst our woes,<br/>
And rescued us from all our foes;<br/>
Who daily feeds each living thing;<br/>
O thank the Heav’n’s Almighty King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O praise the Lord, for He is kind,<br/>
Give thanks to Him with heart and mind;<br/>
His mercy flows an endless stream,<br/>
To all eternity the same.<br/>
