title: King might miss the guiding star

<br/>
A king might miss the guiding star,<br/>
A wise man’s foot might stumble;<br/>
For Bethlehem is very far<br/>
From all except the humble.<br/>
’Tis Christmas Day! ’Tis Christmas Day!<br/>
And Christian hearts are humble.<br/>
<br/>
Some pilgrims seek a hallowed shrine;<br/>
Some soldiers march to danger;<br/>
Some travelers seek an inn—its sign<br/>
“The Baby in a manger.”<br/>
When Christ was born on Christmas morn,<br/>
They laid Him in a manger.<br/>
<br/>
There is no palace in that place,<br/>
Nor any seat of learning,<br/>
No hilltop vision of God’s face,<br/>
No altar candles burning:<br/>
O come and see our Christmas tree<br/>
And Christmas candles burning.<br/>
<br/>
But he who gets to Bethlehem<br/>
Shall hear the oxen lowing;<br/>
And, if he humbly kneel with them,<br/>
May catch far trumpets blowing;<br/>
From far away, on Christmas Day,<br/>
May hear God’s trumpets blowing.<br/>
