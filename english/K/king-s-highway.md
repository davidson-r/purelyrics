<br/>
I know not where the road will lead<br/>
I follow day by day,<br/>
Or where it ends: I only know<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
<br/>
I know not if the way is long,<br/>
And no one else can say;<br/>
But rough or smooth, up hill or down,<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
<br/>
And some I love have reached the end,<br/>
But some with me may stay,<br/>
Their faith and hope still guiding me:<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
<br/>
The way is truth, the way is love,<br/>
For light and strength I pray,<br/>
And through the years of life, to God,<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
<br/>
The countless hosts lead on before,<br/>
I must not fear nor stray;<br/>
With them, the pilgrims of the faith,<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
<br/>
Through light and dark the road leads on<br/>
Till dawns the endless day,<br/>
When I shall know why in this life<br/>
I walk the King’s highway.<br/>
