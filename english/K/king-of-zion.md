<br/>
Zion’s mount His royal seat,<br/>
And no pow’r His throne shall move;<br/>
Ages gather at His feet,<br/>
Son of God’s eternal love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hail, hail, King of Zion!<br/>
Hail, Lord of lords, and King of kings!<br/>
Reign forever, King of Zion;<br/>
Reign, blessèd King, forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
All the world His Name shall fear,<br/>
All the world from shore to shore;<br/>
Every isle His voice shall hear,<br/>
And the heathen rage no more.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He shall mold each stubborn will,<br/>
As the potter molds the clay,<br/>
Till rebellious hearts are stilled,<br/>
And submissive to His sway.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Haste our early gifts to bring,<br/>
Haste obedient faith to prove,<br/>
Haste with songs to Zion’s King,<br/>
Son of God’s eternal love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
