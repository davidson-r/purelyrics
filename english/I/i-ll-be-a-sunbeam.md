<center>
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,<br/>
To shine for Him each day;<br/>
In every way try to please Him,<br/>
At home, at school, at play.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,<br/>
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam;<br/>
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,<br/>
I’ll be a sunbeam for Him.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus wants me to be loving,<br/>
And kind to all I see;<br/>
Showing how pleasant and happy<br/>
His little one can be.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I will ask Jesus to help me<br/>
To keep my heart from sin,<br/>
Ever reflecting His goodness,<br/>
And always shine for Him.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I’ll be a sunbeam for Jesus;<br/>
I can if I but try;<br/>
Serving Him moment by moment,<br/>
Then live with Him on high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
