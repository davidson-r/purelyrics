<br/>
In a manger laid so lowly,<br/>
Came the Prince of Peace to earth;<br/>
While a choir of angels holy<br/>
Sang to celebrate His birth.<br/>
“Glory in the highest,”<br/>
Sang the glad angelic strain:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Glory in the highest,”<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men,”<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
<br/>
As the wise men from far Persia<br/>
Brought rich gifts to Jewry’s King,<br/>
Grateful love, a richer treasure,<br/>
Would we as our offering bring.<br/>
“Glory in the highest,”<br/>
Let us join th’angelic strain;<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Where Christ’s joyful kingdom cometh,<br/>
Deserts blossom as the rose;<br/>
And God’s gracious rain descendeth,<br/>
Where the coral island grows.<br/>
“Glory in the highest,”<br/>
Once more sing th’angelic strain:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
