<br/>
I heard the bells on Christmas day<br/>
Their old familiar carols play,<br/>
And wild and sweet the words repeat<br/>
Of peace on earth, good will to men.<br/>
<br/>
And thought how, as the day had come,<br/>
The belfries of all Christendom<br/>
Had rolled along the unbroken song<br/>
Of peace on earth, good will to men.<br/>
<br/>
Till ringing, singing on its way<br/>
The world revolved from night to day,<br/>
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime<br/>
Of peace on earth, good will to men.<br/>
<br/>
And in despair I bowed my head<br/>
“There is no peace on earth,” I said,<br/>
“For hate is strong and mocks the song<br/>
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
<br/>
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:<br/>
“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;<br/>
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail<br/>
With peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
