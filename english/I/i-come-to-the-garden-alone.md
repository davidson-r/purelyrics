title: I Come To The Garden Alone

<br/>
I come to the garden alone<br/>
While the dew is still on the roses<br/>
And the voice I hear falling on my ear<br/>
The Son of God discloses.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,<br/>
And He tells me I am His own;<br/>
And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br/>
None other has ever known.<br/>
<br/>
He speaks, and the sound of His voice,<br/>
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,<br/>
And the melody that He gave to me<br/>
Within my heart is ringing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Iâ€™d stay in the garden with Him<br/>
Though the night around me be falling,<br/>
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe<br/>
His voice to me is calling.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
