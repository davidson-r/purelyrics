I am the Vine, you are the branches<br/>
He who abides in Me and I in him<br/>
He it is that bears much fruit<br/>
For apart from Me you can do nothing (repeat)<br/>
<br/>
If you abide in Me and My words abide in you<br/>
Ask what you will and it shall be given to you<br/>
<br/>
I am the Vine, you are the branches<br/>
He who abides in Me and I in him<br/>
He it is that bears much fruit<br/>
For apart from Me you can do nothing<br/>
<br/>
He it is that bears much fruit<br/>
For apart from Me you can do nothing. <br/>
