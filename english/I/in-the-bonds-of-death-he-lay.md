In the bonds of death He lay,<br/>
Who for our offense was slain,<br/>
But the Lord is risen today,<br/>
Christ hath brought us life again;<br/>
Wherefore let us all rejoice,<br/>
Singing loud with cheerful voice.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ, God’s only Son,<br/>
Came at last our foe to smite,<br/>
All our sins away hath done,<br/>
Done away death’s power and right;<br/>
Only the form of death is left,<br/>
Of his sting he is bereft.<br/>
<br/>
’Twas a wondrous war I trow,<br/>
Life and death together fought,<br/>
But life hath triumphed o’er his foe,<br/>
Death is mocked, and set at naught;<br/>
Yea, ’tis as the Scripture saith,<br/>
Christ through death hath conquered death.<br/>
<br/>
Now our Paschal Lamb is He,<br/>
And by Him alone we live,<br/>
Who to death upon the tree<br/>
For our sake Himself did give.<br/>
Faith His blood strikes on our door,<br/>
Death dares never harm us more.<br/>
<br/>
On this day, most blest of days,<br/>
Let us keep high festival,<br/>
For our God hath showed His grace,<br/>
And His sun hath risen on all,<br/>
And our hearts rejoice to see<br/>
Sin and night before Him flee.<br/>
<br/>
To the supper of the Lord<br/>
Gladly will we come today;<br/>
The word of peace is now restored,<br/>
The old leaven is put away;<br/>
Christ will be our food alone,<br/>
Faith no life but His will own.
