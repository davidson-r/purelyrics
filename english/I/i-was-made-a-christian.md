<br/>
I was made a Christian<br/>
When my name was giv’n,<br/>
One of God’s dear children,<br/>
And an heir of heaven.<br/>
In the name of Christian<br/>
I will glory now,<br/>
Evermore remember<br/>
My baptismal vow.<br/>
<br/>
I must, like a Christian<br/>
Shun all evil ways,<br/>
Keep the faith of Jesus,<br/>
Serve Him all my days.<br/>
Called to be a Christian<br/>
I will praise the Lord,<br/>
Seek for His assistance<br/>
So to keep my word.<br/>
<br/>
All a Christian’s blessings<br/>
I will claim for mine;<br/>
Holy work and worship,<br/>
Fellowship divine.<br/>
Father, Son, and Spirit,<br/>
Give me grace, that I,<br/>
Still may live a Christian,<br/>
And a Christian die.<br/>
