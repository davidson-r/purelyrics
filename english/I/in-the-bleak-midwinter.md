title: In the bleak midwinter

<br/>
In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,<br/>
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;<br/>
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,<br/>
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.<br/>
<br/>
Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;<br/>
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.<br/>
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed<br/>
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,<br/>
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;<br/>
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,<br/>
The ox and ass and camel which adore.<br/>
<br/>
Angels and archangels may have gathered there,<br/>
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;<br/>
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,<br/>
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
What can I give Him, poor as I am?<br/>
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br/>
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;<br/>
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.<br/>
