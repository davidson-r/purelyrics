<br/>
I call the worldâ€™s Redeemer mine;<br/>
He lives Who died for me, I know;<br/>
Who bought my soul with blood divine,<br/>
Jesus, shall re-appear below,<br/>
Stand in that dreadful day unknown,<br/>
And fix on earth His heavenly throne.<br/>
<br/>
Then the last judgment-day shall come;<br/>
And though the worms this skin devour,<br/>
The Judge shall call me from the tomb,<br/>
Shall bid the greedy grave restore,<br/>
And raise this individual me,<br/>
God in the flesh, my God, to see.<br/>
<br/>
In this identic body I,<br/>
With eyes of flesh refined, restored,<br/>
Shall see that self-same Savior nigh.<br/>
See for myself my smiling Lord,<br/>
See with ineffable delight;<br/>
Nor faint to hear the glorious sight.<br/>
<br/>
Then let the worms demand their prey,<br/>
The greedy grave my reins consume;<br/>
With joy I drop my mouldering clay,<br/>
And rest till my Redeemer come;<br/>
On Christ, my Life, in death rely,<br/>
Secure that I can never die.<br/>
