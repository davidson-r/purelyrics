title: I Think When I Read That Sweet Story

<br/>
I think, when I read that sweet story of old,<br/>
When Jesus was here among men,<br/>
How He called little children as lambs to His fold,<br/>
I should like to have been with them then.<br/>
<br/>
I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,<br/>
That His arms had been thrown around me,<br/>
And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,<br/>
“Let the little ones come unto Me.”<br/>
<br/>
Yet still to His foot stool in prayer I may go;<br/>
And ask for a share in His love;<br/>
And if I thus earnestly seek Him below,<br/>
I shall see Him and hear Him above.<br/>
<br/>
But thousands and thousands who wander and fall,<br/>
Never heard of that heavenly home;<br/>
I wish they could know there is room for them all,<br/>
And that Jesus has bid them to come.<br/>
<br/>
In that beautiful place He has gone to prepare<br/>
For all who are washed and forgiven;<br/>
And many dear children shall be with Him there,<br/>
For “of such is the kingdom of heaven.”<br/>
<br/>
I long for the joy of that glorious time,<br/>
The sweetest and brightest and best,<br/>
When the dear little children of every clime<br/>
Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.<br/>
