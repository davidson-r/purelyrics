title: It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

It came upon the midnight clear,<br/>
That glorious song of old,<br/>
From angels bending near the earth,<br/>
To touch their harps of gold:<br/>
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men<br/>
From heavens all gracious King!"<br/>
The world in solemn stillness lay<br/>
To hear the angels sing.<br/>
<br/>
Still through the cloven skies they come,<br/>
With peaceful wings unfurled;<br/>
And still their heavenly music floats<br/>
O'er all the weary world:<br/>
Above its sad and lowly plains<br/>
They bend on hovering wing,<br/>
And ever o'er its Babel sounds<br/>
The blessed angels sing.<br/>
<br/>
O ye beneath life's crushing load,<br/>
Whose forms are bending low,<br/>
Who toil along the climbing way<br/>
With painful steps and slow;<br/>
Look now, for glad and golden hours<br/>
Come swiftly on the wing;<br/>
Oh rest beside the weary road<br/>
And hear the angels sing.<br/>
<br/>
For lo! the days are hastening on,<br/>
By prophets seen of old,<br/>
When with the ever-circling years<br/>
Shall come the time foretold,<br/>
When the new heaven and earth shall own<br/>
The Prince of Peace, their King,<br/>
And the whole world send back the song<br/>
Which now the angels sing.
