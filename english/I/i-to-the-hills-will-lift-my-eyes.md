title: I To The Hills Will Lift My Eyes

<br/>
I to the hills will lift my eyes;<br/>
O whence shall come my aid?<br/>
My help is from the Lord alone,<br/>
Who Heav’n and earth has made.<br/>
<br/>
He will not let thy foot be moved,<br/>
Thy Guardian never sleeps;<br/>
With watchful and unslumbering care,<br/>
His own He safely keeps.<br/>
<br/>
Thy faithful Keeper is the Lord,<br/>
Thy Shelter and thy Shade;<br/>
’Neath sun or moon, by day or night,<br/>
Thou shalt not be afraid.<br/>
<br/>
From evil He will keep thee safe,<br/>
For thee He will provide;<br/>
Thy going out, thy coming in,<br/>
Forever He will guide.<br/>
