<br/>
I am so glad each Christmas Eve,<br/>
The night of Jesus’ birth!<br/>
Then like the sun the Star shone forth,<br/>
And angels sang on earth.<br/>
<br/>
The little Child in Bethlehem,<br/>
He was a King indeed!<br/>
For He came down from Heaven above<br/>
To help a world in need.<br/>
<br/>
He dwells again in heaven’s realm,<br/>
The Son of God today;<br/>
And still He loves His little ones<br/>
And hears them when they pray.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad on Christmas Eve!<br/>
His praises then I sing;<br/>
He opens then for every child<br/>
The palace of the King.<br/>
<br/>
When mother trims the Christmas tree<br/>
Which fills the room with light,<br/>
She tells me of the wondrous Star<br/>
That made the dark world bright.<br/>
<br/>
She says the Star is shining still,<br/>
And never will grow dim;<br/>
And if it shines upon my way,<br/>
It leads me up to Him.<br/>
<br/>
And so I love each Christmas Eve<br/>
And I love Jesus, too;<br/>
And that He loves me every day<br/>
I know so well is true.<br/>
