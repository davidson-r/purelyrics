<br/>
I know not the hour when my Lord will come<br/>
To take me away to His own dear home;<br/>
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,<br/>
And that will be glory for me.<br/>
And that will be glory for me,<br/>
Oh, that will be glory for me!<br/>
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,<br/>
And that will be glory for me.<br/>
<br/>
I know not the song that the angels sing,<br/>
I know not the sound of the harps’ glad ring;<br/>
But I know there’ll be mention of Jesus our King,<br/>
And that will be music for me.<br/>
And that will be music for me,<br/>
Oh, that will be music for me!<br/>
But I know there’ll be mention of Jesus our King,<br/>
And that will be music for me.<br/>
<br/>
I know not the form of my mansion fair,<br/>
I know not the name that I then shall bear;<br/>
But I know that my Savior will welcome me there,<br/>
And that will be Heaven for me.<br/>
And that will be Heaven for me,<br/>
Oh, that will be Heaven for me.<br/>
But I know that my Savior will welcome me there,<br/>
And that will be Heaven for me.<br/>
