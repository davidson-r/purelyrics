<center>
In stature grows the heavenly Child,<br/>
With death before His eyes;<br/>
A Lamb unblemished, meek and mild,<br/>
Prepared for sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
The Son of God His glory hides<br/>
With parents mean and poor;<br/>
And He Who made the heaven abides<br/>
In dwelling place obscure.<br/>
<br/>
Those mighty hands that stay the sky<br/>
No earthly toil refuse;<br/>
And He Who set the stars on high<br/>
An humble trade pursues.<br/>
<br/>
He before Whom the angels stand,<br/>
At Whose behest they fly,<br/>
Now yields himself to man’s command,<br/>
And lay His glory by.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, the virgin’s holy Son,<br/>
We praise Thee and adore,<br/>
Who art with god the Father One,<br/>
And Spirit evermore.
