title: I watch the sunrise

I watch the sunrise lighting the sky, <br/>
Casting its shadows near. <br/>
And on this morning bright though it be, <br/>
I feel those shadows near me.<br/>
<br/>
But you are always close to me <br/>
Following all my ways. <br/>
May I be always close to you <br/>
Following all your ways, Lord.<br/>
<br/>
I watch the sunlight shine through the clouds, <br/>
Warming the earth below. <br/>
And at the mid-day, life seems to say: <br/>
I feel your brightness near me. <br/>
For you are always . . .<br/>
<br/>
I watch the sunset fading away, <br/>
Lighting the clouds with sleep. <br/>
And as the evening closes its eyes, <br/>
I feel your presence near me. <br/>
For you are always . . .<br/>
<br/>
I watch the moonlight guarding the night, <br/>
Waiting till morning comes. <br/>
The air is silent, earth is at rest <br/>
Only your peace is near me. <br/>
Yes, you are always...
