title: I Love To Hear The Story

<br/>
I love to hear the story which angel voices tell,<br/>
How once the King of glory came down on earth to dwell.<br/>
I am both weak and sinful; but this I surely know,<br/>
The Lord came down to save me, because He loved me so.<br/>
<br/>
I’m glad my blessèd Savior was once a child like me,<br/>
To show how pure and holy His little ones might be;<br/>
And, if I try to follow His footsteps here below,<br/>
He never will forget me, because He loves me so.<br/>
<br/>
To sing His love and mercy my sweetest songs I’ll raise;<br/>
And, though I cannot see Him, I know he hears my praise;<br/>
For He has kindly promised that even I may go<br/>
To sing among His angels, because He loves me so.<br/>
