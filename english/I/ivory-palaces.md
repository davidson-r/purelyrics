<center>
<br/>
My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,<br/>
And myrrh their texture fills;<br/>
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine<br/>
With joy my being thrills.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Out of the ivory palaces,<br/>
Into a world of woe,<br/>
Only His great eternal love<br/>
Made my Savior go.<br/>
<br/>
His life had also its sorrows sore,<br/>
For aloes had a part;<br/>
And when I think of the cross He bore,<br/>
My eyes with teardrops start.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
His garments too were in cassia dipped,<br/>
With healing in a touch;<br/>
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,<br/>
He took me from its clutch.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In garments glorious He will come,<br/>
To open wide the door;<br/>
And I shall enter my heavâ€™nly home,<br/>
To dwell forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
