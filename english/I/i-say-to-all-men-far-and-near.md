<br/>
I say to all men far and near<br/>
That He is risen again;<br/>
That He is with us now and here,<br/>
And ever shall remain.<br/>
<br/>
And what I say, let each this morn,<br/>
Go tell it to his friend,<br/>
That soon in every place shall dawn<br/>
His kingdom without end.<br/>
<br/>
The fears of death and of the grave<br/>
Are whelmed beneath the sea;<br/>
And every heart now light and brave<br/>
May face the things to be.<br/>
<br/>
The way of darkness that He trod<br/>
To heaven at last shall come,<br/>
And he who hearkens to His Word<br/>
Shall reach His Father’s home.<br/>
<br/>
Now let the mourner grieve no more<br/>
Though his belovèd sleep:<br/>
A happier meeting shall restore<br/>
Their light to eyes that weep.<br/>
<br/>
He lives! His presence hath not ceased,<br/>
Though foes and fears be rife;<br/>
And thus we hail in Easter’s feast<br/>
A world renewed to life!<br/>
