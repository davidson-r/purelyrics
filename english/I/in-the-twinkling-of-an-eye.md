title: In The Twinkling Of An Eye

<br/>
When the trump of the great archangel<br/>
Its mighty tones shall sound,<br/>
And, the end of the age proclaiming,<br/>
Shall pierce the depths profound;<br/>
When the Son of Man shall come in His glory<br/>
To take the saints on high,<br/>
What a shouting in the skies from the multitudes that rise,<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye,<br/>
The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised,<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
When He comes in the clouds descending,<br/>
And they who loved Him here,<br/>
From their graves shall awake and praise Him<br/>
With joy and not with fear;<br/>
When the body and the soul are united,<br/>
And clothed no more to die,<br/>
What a shouting there will be when each other’s face we see,<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O the seed that was sown in weakness<br/>
Shall then be raised in pow’r<br/>
And the songs of the blood bought millions<br/>
Shall hail that blissful hour;<br/>
When we gather safely home in the morning,<br/>
And night’s dark shadows fly,<br/>
What a shouting on the shore when we meet to part no more,<br/>
Changed in the twinkling of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
