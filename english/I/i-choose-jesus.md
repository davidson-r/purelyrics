<br/>
When I need someone in time of grief,<br/>
Someone my cheer to be,<br/>
Jesus I choose, for He gives relief,<br/>
He is the best for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I choose Jesus when I need a friend,<br/>
What I need I know that He will send;<br/>
I have proved Him, good and true is He;<br/>
I choose Jesus, He is the best for me.<br/>
<br/>
When I need someone to guide my soul<br/>
Over the stormy sea,<br/>
Always to Jesus I give control,<br/>
He is the best for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When I need help to defeat the foe,<br/>
Someone my shield to be,<br/>
Always to Jesus in faith I go,<br/>
He is the best for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When all my trials on earth are oâ€™er,<br/>
And the dark stream I see,<br/>
Jesus shall bear me to yonder shore,<br/>
He is the best for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
