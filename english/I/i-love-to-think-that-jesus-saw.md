title: I Love To Think That Jesus Saw

I love to think that Jesus saw<br/>
The same bright sun that shines today;<br/>
It gave Him light to do His work,<br/>
And smiled upon His play.<br/>
<br/>
The same white moon with silver face<br/>
That sails across the sky at night,<br/>
He used to see in Galilee,<br/>
And watch it with delight.<br/>
<br/>
The same great God that hears my prayers<br/>
Heard His, when Jesus knelt to pray;<br/>
He is my Father, Who will keep<br/>
His child through every day.
