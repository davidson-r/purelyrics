title: I Vow To Thee My Country

<br/>
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,<br/>
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:<br/>
The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,<br/>
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;<br/>
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,<br/>
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,<br/>
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;<br/>
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;<br/>
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;<br/>
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,<br/>
And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.<br/>
