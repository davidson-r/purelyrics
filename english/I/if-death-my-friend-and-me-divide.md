title: If Death My Friend And Me Divide

<center>
<br/>
If death my friend and me divide,<br/>
Thou dost not, Lord, my sorrow chide,<br/>
Or frown my tears to see;<br/>
Restrained from passionate excess,<br/>
Thou bidst me mourn in calm distress<br/>
For them that rest in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
I feel a strong immortal hope,<br/>
Which bears my mournful spirit up<br/>
Beneath its mountain load;<br/>
Redeemed from death, and grief, and pain,<br/>
I soon shall find my friend again<br/>
Within the arms of God.<br/>
<br/>
Pass a few fleeting moments more<br/>
And death the blessing shall restore<br/>
Which death has snatched away;<br/>
For me Thou wilt the summons send,<br/>
And give me back my parted friend<br/>
In that eternal day.<br/>
