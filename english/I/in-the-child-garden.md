<br/>
In the garden, in the garden of Jesus our Savior,<br/>
We are growing, we are growing for Jesus alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Like the flow’rs of the morning His garden adorning,<br/>
We are growing for Jesus, His loved and His own.<br/>
<br/>
Little children, little children are the flow’rs in His garden,<br/>
We must blossom, we must blossom, for Jesus alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves us, Jesus loves us, the flow’rs of His garden;<br/>
He will keep us, He will keep us, nor leave us alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We must love him, we must love Him, this Jesus our Savior,<br/>
We must trust Him, we must trust Him, in Jesus alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
