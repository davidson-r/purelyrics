Immanuel, we sing Thy praise;<br/>
Thou Prince of Life, Thou Fount of Grace,<br/>
With all Thy saints, Thee, Lord, we sing;<br/>
Praise, honor, thanks, to Thee we bring.<br/>
<br/>
E’er since the world began to be,<br/>
How many a heart hath longed for Thee!<br/>
And Thou, O long expected guest,<br/>
Hast come at last to make us blest!<br/>
<br/>
Now art Thou here: we know Thee now:<br/>
In lowly manger liest Thou:<br/>
A Child, yet makest all things great;<br/>
Poor, yet the earth Thy robe of state.<br/>
<br/>
Now fearlessly I come to Thee:<br/>
From sin and grief O set me free!<br/>
Turn wrath away, dread death destroy,<br/>
And turn my sorrow into joy.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art my Head, my Lord divine:<br/>
I am Thy member, wholly Thine;<br/>
And by Thy Spirit’s gracious power<br/>
Will seek to serve Thee evermore.
