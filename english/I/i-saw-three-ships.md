<br/>
I saw three ships come sailing in<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
I saw three ships come sailing in<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
And what was in those ships all three,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?<br/>
And what was in those ships all three,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning?<br/>
<br/>
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning?<br/>
<br/>
O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
And all the bells on earth shall ring,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
And all the bells on earth shall ring,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
And all the souls on earth shall sing,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
And all the souls on earth shall sing,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Then let us all rejoice again,<br/>
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br/>
Then let us all rejoice again,<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morning.<br/>
