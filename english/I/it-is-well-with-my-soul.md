title: It Is Well With My Soul

<center>
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,<br/>
When sorrows like sea billows roll;<br/>
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,<br/>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
It is well, with my soul,<br/>
It is well, with my soul,<br/>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br/>
Let this blest assurance control,<br/>
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,<br/>
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!<br/>
My sin, not in part but the whole,<br/>
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,<br/>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:<br/>
If Jordan above me shall roll,<br/>
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life<br/>
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,<br/>
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;<br/>
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!<br/>
Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br/>
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;<br/>
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,<br/>
Even so, it is well with my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
