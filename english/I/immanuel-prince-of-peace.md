<br/>
Oh, sing that song to me again,<br/>
Whose charm doth never cease,<br/>
Of Him who died for sinful men:<br/>
Immanuel, Prince of Peace;<br/>
The peerless One of all the throng<br/>
Who’ve walked our earthly sod;<br/>
The sweetest name that lives in song:<br/>
Christ Jesus, Son of God.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sing that song to me again,<br/>
Whose charm doth never cease,<br/>
Of Him who died for sinful men:<br/>
Immanuel, Prince of Peace.<br/>
<br/>
When I, a lisping infant, lay<br/>
Upon my mother’s knee,<br/>
She told me in the twilight gray,<br/>
How Jesus died for me;<br/>
She sang a song of Heav’n and God<br/>
I never can forget;<br/>
And tho’ she sleeps beneath the sod,<br/>
Her song is living yet.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, song of songs, that grows sublime<br/>
As onward roll the years,<br/>
Oh, story woven into rhyme,<br/>
That melts the heart to tears;<br/>
I love, I love to hear that song,<br/>
It fills my soul with joy;<br/>
To Him all songs of praise belong<br/>
Which mortal tongues employ.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
