<br/>
Infant holy, Infant lowly, for His bed a cattle stall;<br/>
Oxen lowing, little knowing, Christ the Babe is Lord of all.<br/>
Swift are winging angels singing, noels ringing, tidings bringing:<br/>
Christ the Babe is Lord of all.<br/>
<br/>
Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping vigil till the morning new<br/>
Saw the glory, heard the story, tidings of a Gospel true.<br/>
Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, praises voicing, greet the morrow:<br/>
Christ the Babe was born for you.<br/>
