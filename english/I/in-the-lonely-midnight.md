<br/>
In the lonely midnight on the wintry hill,<br/>
Shepherds heard the angels singing, “Peace, good will.”<br/>
Listen, O ye weary, to the angels’ song,<br/>
Unto to you the tidings of great joy belong.<br/>
<br/>
Though in David’s city angels sing no more,<br/>
Love makes angel music on earth’s darkest shore;<br/>
Though no heavenly glory meet your wondering eyes,<br/>
Love can make your dwelling bright as paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Child of Mary, sent from heaven on high,<br/>
In His manger cradle may no longer lie,<br/>
Love is King forever, though the proud world scorn;<br/>
If ye truly seek Him, Christ your King is born.<br/>
