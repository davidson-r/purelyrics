title: In Lifes Earnest Morning

<center>
<br/>
In life’s earnest morning, when our hope was high,<br/>
Came Thy voice to summons, not to be put by;<br/>
Nor in toil nor sorrow, weakness or dismay,<br/>
Need we ever falter art not Thou our stay?<br/>
<br/>
Teach us, Lord, Thy wisdom, while we seek men’s lore;<br/>
May the mind be humbled as we know Thee more;<br/>
Let the larger vision bring the childlike heart,<br/>
And our deeper knowledge holier zeal impart.<br/>
<br/>
Should Thy face be clouded to our spirits’ sight,<br/>
Speak thro’ human kindness, shine thro’ nature’s light,<br/>
In the face of loved ones, or the ties of home<br/>
Only, gracious Father, to Thy children come.<br/>
<br/>
Save us, Lord, from seeking earth’s unhallowed goals;<br/>
May our lifelong passion be the love of souls;<br/>
Let us live and labor, Father, in Thy sight,<br/>
Thro’ the grace of Jesus, by the Spirit’s might.<br/>
