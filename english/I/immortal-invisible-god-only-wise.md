Immortal, invisible, God only wise,<br/>
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,<br/>
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,<br/>
Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.<br/>
<br/>
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,<br/>
Nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might;<br/>
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above<br/>
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.<br/>
<br/>
To all life thou givest to both great and small;<br/>
In all life thou livest, the true life of all;<br/>
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,<br/>
And wither and perish but nought changeth thee.<br/>
<br/>
Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,<br/>
Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;<br/>
All laud we would render: O help us to see<br/>
'Tis only the splendour of light hideth thee.
