title: I Know Not How that Bethlehems Babe

<br/>
I know not how that Bethlehem’s Babe<br/>
Could in the Godhead be;<br/>
I only know the manger Child<br/>
Has brought God’s life to me.<br/>
<br/>
I know not how that Calvary’s cross<br/>
A world from sin could free;<br/>
I only know its matchless love<br/>
Has brought God’s love to me.<br/>
<br/>
I know not how that Joseph’s tomb<br/>
Could solve death’s mystery;<br/>
I only know a living Christ,<br/>
Our immortality.<br/>
