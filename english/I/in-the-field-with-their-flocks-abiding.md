<br/>
In the field with their flocks abiding,<br/>
They lay on the dewy ground;<br/>
And glimmering under the starlight,<br/>
The sheep lay white around;<br/>
When the light of the Lord streamed o’er them,<br/>
And lo! from heaven above,<br/>
An angel leaned from the glory,<br/>
And sang his song of love.<br/>
He sang, that first sweet Christmas,<br/>
The song that shall never cease.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God in the highest,<br/>
On earth good will and peace.”<br/>
<br/>
“To you in the city of David<br/>
A Savior is born today!”<br/>
And sudden a host of the heavenly ones<br/>
Flashed forth to join the lay.<br/>
O never hath sweeter message<br/>
Thrilled home to the souls of men<br/>
And the heavens themselves had never heard<br/>
A gladder choir till then.<br/>
For they sang that Christmas carol<br/>
That never on earth shall cease.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And the shepherds came to the manger,<br/>
And gazed on the Holy Child;<br/>
And calmly o’er that rude cradle<br/>
The virgin mother smiled;<br/>
And the sky in the starlit silence,<br/>
Seemed full of the angel lay:<br/>
“To you in the City of David<br/>
A Savior is born today!”<br/>
O they sang, and we pray that never<br/>
The carol on earth shall cease.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
