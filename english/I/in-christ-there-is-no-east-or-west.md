<br/>
In Christ there is no East or West,<br/>
In Him no South or North;<br/>
But one great fellowship of love<br/>
Throughout the whole wide earth.<br/>
<br/>
In Him shall true hearts everywhere<br/>
Their high communion find;<br/>
His service is the golden cord,<br/>
Close binding humankind.<br/>
<br/>
Join hands, then, members of the faith,<br/>
Whatever your race may be!<br/>
Who serves my Father as His child<br/>
Is surely kin to me.<br/>
<br/>
In Christ now meet both East and West,<br/>
In Him meet North and South;<br/>
All Christly souls are one in Him<br/>
Throughout the whole wide earth.<br/>
