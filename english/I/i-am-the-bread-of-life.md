title: I am the bread of life

<br/>
I am the bread of life, broken for all.<br/>
Eat now and hunger no more.<br/>
One faith, one hope, one symbol of love<br/>
given to us in this one bread,<br/>
one cup. O let us be one in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
You are my friends if you keep my commands,<br/>
no longer servants but friends.<br/>
<br/>
See how my people have nothing to eat.<br/>
Give them the bread that is you.<br/>
<br/>
As God has loved me so I have loved you.<br/>
Go and live on in my love. <br/>
