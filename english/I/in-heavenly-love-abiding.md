title: In Heavenly Love Abiding

<br/>
In heavenly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear.<br/>
And safe in such confiding, for nothing changes here.<br/>
The storm may roar without me, my heart may low be laid,<br/>
But God is round about me, and can I be dismayed?<br/>
<br/>
Wherever He may guide me, no want shall turn me back.<br/>
My Shepherd is beside me, and nothing can I lack.<br/>
His wisdom ever waking, His sight is never dim.<br/>
He knows the way Heâ€™s taking, and I will walk with Him<br/>
<br/>
Green pastures are before me, which yet I have not seen.<br/>
Bright skies will soon be over me, where darkest clouds have been.<br/>
My hope I cannot measure, my path to life is free.<br/>
My Savior has my treasure, and He will walk with me.<br/>
