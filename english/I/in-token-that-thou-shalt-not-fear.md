title: In Token That Thou Shalt Not Fear

<br/>
In token that thou shalt not fear<br/>
Christ crucified to own,<br/>
We print the cross upon thee here,<br/>
And stamp thee His alone.<br/>
<br/>
In token that thou shalt not blush<br/>
To glory in His Name,<br/>
We blazon here upon thy front<br/>
His glory and His shame.<br/>
<br/>
In token that thou shalt not flinch<br/>
Christ’s quarrel to maintain,<br/>
But ’neath His banner manfully<br/>
Firm at thy post remain.<br/>
<br/>
In token that thou too shalt tread<br/>
The path He traveled by,<br/>
Endure the cross, despise the shame,<br/>
And sit thee down on high.<br/>
<br/>
Thus outwardly and visibly<br/>
We seal thee for His own;<br/>
And may the brow that wears His cross<br/>
Hereafter share His crown.<br/>
