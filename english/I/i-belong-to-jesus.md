<center>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
I am not my own;<br/>
All I have and all I am,<br/>
Shall be His alone.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
He is Lord and King,<br/>
Reigning in my inmost heart,<br/>
Over everything.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
Blessèd, blessèd thought!<br/>
With His own most precious blood<br/>
Has my soul been bought.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
He has died for me;<br/>
I am His and He is mine,<br/>
Through eternity.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
He will keep my soul,<br/>
When the deathly waters dark<br/>
Round about me roll.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to Jesus;<br/>
And ere long I’ll stand<br/>
With my precious Savior there<br/>
In the glory land.
