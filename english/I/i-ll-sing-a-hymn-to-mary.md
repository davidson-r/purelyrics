<br/>
I'll sing a hymn to Mary,<br/>
The Mother of my God;<br/>
The Virgin of all virgins, <br/>
Of David's royal blood.<br/>
O teach me, holy Mary,<br/>
A loving song to frame;<br/>
When wicked men blaspheme thee,<br/>
To love and bless thy name. <br/>
<br/>
The saints are hight in glory,<br/>
With golden crowns so bright,<br/>
But brighter far is Mary<br/>
Upon her throne of light.<br/>
O that which God did give thee,<br/>
Let mortal ne'er disclaim;<br/>
When wicked men blaspheme thee<br/>
I'll love and bless thy name. <br/>
