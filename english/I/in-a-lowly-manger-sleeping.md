<br/>
In a lowly manger sleeping,<br/>
Calm and still a Babe we see,<br/>
’Tis the Holy Child of promise,<br/>
Light of all the world is He.<br/>
<br/>
Holy angels sing His welcome<br/>
In the realms of glory bright,<br/>
While the morning stars around Him<br/>
Fall in soft and tender light.<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd Savior, dear Redeemer,<br/>
King of Judah, Prince of Peace,<br/>
Rock of Ages, Star of nations,<br/>
Thy dominion ne’er shall cease.<br/>
