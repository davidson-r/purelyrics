<br/>
In our day of thanksgiving one psalm let us offer<br/>
For the saints who before us have found their reward;<br/>
When the shadow of death fell upon them, we sorrowed,<br/>
But now we rejoice that they rest in the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning of life, and at noon, and at even,<br/>
He called them away from our worship below;<br/>
But not till His love, at the font and the altar,<br/>
Had girt them with grace for the way they should go.<br/>
<br/>
These stones that have echoed their praises are holy,<br/>
And dear is the ground where their feet have once trod;<br/>
Yet here they confessed they were strangers and pilgrims,<br/>
And still they were seeking the city of God.<br/>
<br/>
Sing praise, then, for all who here sought and here found Him,<br/>
Whose journey is ended, whose perils are past;<br/>
They believed in the Light; and its glory is round them,<br/>
Where the clouds of earth’s sorrows are lifted at last.<br/>
