title: Ill count my blessings

<center>
<br/>
I lift my heart today in praise<br/>
To Him Who loves me so,<br/>
Whose mercy crowneth all my days,<br/>
And makes my cup o’erflow.<br/>
O have I loved Him as I should<br/>
For all His blessings free?<br/>
Praise God Who giveth naught but good,<br/>
For He is good to me!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I’ll count my blessings—<br/>
Count them o’er and o’er—<br/>
I’ll tell my Father’s goodness—<br/>
I will love Him more,<br/>
I’ll count my blessings, bountiful and free—<br/>
Yet I can never count them all—<br/>
So good is God to me!<br/>
<br/>
I thank Him for unclouded skies—<br/>
For love beyond my ken—<br/>
That when my path in shadow lies,<br/>
The sunshine comes again.<br/>
I thank Him for the hopes fulfilled—<br/>
For every answered plea,<br/>
That though life was not all I willed,<br/>
My God is good to me!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I go to meet another year,<br/>
With faith no doubt can dim,<br/>
God reigneth, and I will not fear,<br/>
But trust my way with Him.<br/>
Then if that way be bright or dark,<br/>
Let peace unshaken be!<br/>
And let me, like the soaring lark,<br/>
Sing “God is good to me!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain. <br/>
