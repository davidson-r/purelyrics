It fell upon a summer day,<br/>
When Jesus walked in Galilee,<br/>
The mothers from a village brought<br/>
Their children to His knee.<br/>
<br/>
He took them in His arms, and laid<br/>
His hands on each remembered head;<br/>
“Suffer these little ones to come<br/>
To Me,” He gently said.<br/>
<br/>
“Forbid them not. Unless ye bear<br/>
The childlike heart your hearts within,<br/>
Unto My kingdom ye may come,<br/>
But may not enter in.”<br/>
<br/>
Master, I fain would enter there;<br/>
O let me follow Thee and share<br/>
Thy meek and lowly heart, and be<br/>
Freed from all worldly care.<br/>
<br/>
Of innocence, and love, and trust,<br/>
Of quiet work, and simple word,<br/>
Of joy, and thoughtlessness of self,<br/>
Build up my life, good Lord.<br/>
<br/>
All happy thoughts, and gentle ways,<br/>
And lovingkindness daily given,<br/>
And freedom through obedience gained,<br/>
Make in my heart Thy heaven.<br/>
<br/>
O happy thus to live and move!<br/>
And sweet this world, where I shall find<br/>
God’s beauty everywhere, His love,<br/>
His good in all mankind.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, grant this childlike heart,<br/>
That I may come to Christ, and feel<br/>
His hands on me in blessing laid,<br/>
Love-giving, strong to heal.
