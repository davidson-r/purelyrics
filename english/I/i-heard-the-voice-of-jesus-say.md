<br/>
I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Come unto Me and rest;<br/>
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon My breast.”<br/>
I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad;<br/>
I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.<br/>
<br/>
I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Behold, I freely give<br/>
The living water; thirsty one, stoop down, and drink, and live.”<br/>
I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life giving stream;<br/>
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in Him.<br/>
<br/>
I heard the voice of Jesus say, “I am this dark world’s Light;<br/>
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise, and all thy day be bright.”<br/>
I looked to Jesus, and I found in Him my Star, my Sun;<br/>
And in that light of life I’ll walk, till traveling days are done.<br/>
