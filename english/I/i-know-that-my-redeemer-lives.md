I know that my Redeemer lives;<br/>
What comfort this sweet sentence gives!<br/>
He lives, He lives, who once was dead;<br/>
He lives, my ever living Head.<br/>
<br/>
He lives to bless me with His love,<br/>
He lives to plead for me above.<br/>
He lives my hungry soul to feed,<br/>
He lives to help in time of need.<br/>
<br/>
He lives triumphant from the grave,<br/>
He lives eternally to save,<br/>
He lives all glorious in the sky,<br/>
He lives exalted there on high.<br/>
<br/>
He lives to grant me rich supply,<br/>
He lives to guide me with His eye,<br/>
He lives to comfort me when faint,<br/>
He lives to hear my soul’s complaint.<br/>
<br/>
He lives to silence all my fears,<br/>
He lives to wipe away my tears<br/>
He lives to calm my troubled heart,<br/>
He lives all blessings to impart.<br/>
<br/>
He lives, my kind, wise, heavenly Friend,<br/>
He lives and loves me to the end;<br/>
He lives, and while He lives, I’ll sing;<br/>
He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.<br/>
<br/>
He lives and grants me daily breath;<br/>
He lives, and I shall conquer death:<br/>
He lives my mansion to prepare;<br/>
He lives to bring me safely there.<br/>
<br/>
He lives, all glory to His Name!<br/>
He lives, my Jesus, still the same.<br/>
Oh, the sweet joy this sentence gives,<br/>
I know that my Redeemer lives!
