<center>
In our work and in our play,<br/>
Jesus, ever with us stay;<br/>
May we always strive to be<br/>
True and faithful unto Thee.<br/>
Then we truthfully can sing,<br/>
We are children of the King.<br/>
<br/>
May we in Thy strength subdue<br/>
Evil tempers, words untrue,<br/>
Thoughts impure, and deeds unkind,<br/>
All things hateful to Thy mind.<br/>
Then we truthfully can sing,<br/>
We are children of the King.<br/>
<br/>
Children of the King are we!<br/>
May we loyal to Him be;<br/>
Try to please Him every day,<br/>
In our work and in our play.<br/>
Then we truthfully can sing,<br/>
We are children of the King.
