<br/>
I am Jesus’ little lamb,<br/>
Ever glad at heart I am;<br/>
For my Shepherd gently guides me,<br/>
Knows my need, and well provides me,<br/>
Loves me every day the same,<br/>
Even calls me by my name.<br/>
<br/>
Day by day, at home, away,<br/>
Jesus is my Staff and Stay.<br/>
When I hunger, Jesus feeds me,<br/>
Into pleasant pastures leads me;<br/>
When I thirst, He bids me go<br/>
Where the quiet waters flow.<br/>
<br/>
Who so happy as I am,<br/>
Even now the Shepherd’s lamb?<br/>
And when my short life is ended,<br/>
By His angel host attended,<br/>
He shall fold me to His breast,<br/>
There within His arms to rest.<br/>
