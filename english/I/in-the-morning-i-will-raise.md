title: In The Morning I Will Raise

<br/>
In the morning I will raise<br/>
To my God the voice of praise;<br/>
With His kind protection blest,<br/>
Sweet and deep has been my rest.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning I will pray<br/>
For His blessing on the day;<br/>
What this day shall be my lot,<br/>
Light or darkness, I know not.<br/>
<br/>
Should it be with clouds oâ€™ercast,<br/>
Clouds of sorrow gathering fast,<br/>
Thou, Who givest light divine,<br/>
Shine with me, Lord, O shine.<br/>
<br/>
Show me, if I tempted be,<br/>
How to find all strength in Thee,<br/>
And a perfect triumph win<br/>
Over every bosom sin.<br/>
<br/>
Keep my feet from secret snares,<br/>
Keep my eyes, O God, from tears,<br/>
Every step Thy grace attend,<br/>
And my soul from death defend.<br/>
<br/>
Then when fall the shades of night,<br/>
All within shall still be light;<br/>
Thou wilt peace around diffuse,<br/>
Gently as the evening dews.<br/>
