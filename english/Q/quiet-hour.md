title: Quiet hour

<center>
Communion with my Father,<br/>
In calm and quiet hour,<br/>
Is sweet and rich in blessings,<br/>
And Spirit’s gracious power;<br/>
He speaks in tones so gentle,<br/>
He hears my humblest prayer,<br/>
In secret of His presence<br/>
I feel my Father’s care.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O Father, Spirit, Savior,<br/>
Fill us with Thine own power;<br/>
O, lead Thy loving children<br/>
To seek the quiet hour.<br/>
<br/>
When storms are fierce about me,<br/>
And sorrow’s billows roll,<br/>
I hear the Master gently<br/>
Speak peace unto my soul;<br/>
When heart is sore with anguish,<br/>
And eyes are dim with tears,<br/>
A quiet hour with Jesus<br/>
Will banish pain and fears.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, leave life’s noise and turmoil,<br/>
And seek the quiet hour,<br/>
That He who sees in secret<br/>
May give thee spirit-power;<br/>
There find your strength in weakness,<br/>
And gird your armor on,<br/>
Then forth to life’s great conflict<br/>
Till victory is won.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
