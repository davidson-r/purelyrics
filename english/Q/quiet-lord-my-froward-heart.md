<br/>
Quiet, Lord, my froward heart,<br/>
Make me teachable and mild,<br/>
Upright, simple, free from art,<br/>
Make me as a weanèd child:<br/>
From distrust and envy free,<br/>
Pleased with all that pleases Thee.<br/>
<br/>
What Thou shalt today provide,<br/>
Let me as a child receive;<br/>
What tomorrow may betide,<br/>
Calmly to Thy wisdom leave:<br/>
’Tis enough that Thou wilt care,<br/>
Why should I the burden bear?<br/>
<br/>
As a little child relies<br/>
On a care beyond his own;<br/>
Knows he’s neither strong nor wise,<br/>
Fears to stir a step alone:<br/>
Let me thus with Thee abide,<br/>
As my Father, Guard, and Guide.<br/>
<br/>
Thus preserved from Satan’s wiles,<br/>
Safe from dangers, free from fears;<br/>
May I live upon Thy smiles,<br/>
Till the promised hour appears;<br/>
When the sons of God shall prove<br/>
All their Father’s boundless love.<br/>
