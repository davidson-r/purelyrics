<br/>
O Queen of the Holy Rosary, <br/>
O bless us as we pray, <br/>
And offer thee our roses <br/>
In garlands day by day,<br/>
While from our Father's garden,<br/>
With loving hearts and bold,<br/>
We gather to thine honor<br/>
Buds white and red and gold.<br/>
<br/>
O Queen of the Holy Rosary, <br/>
Each myst'ry blends with thine <br/>
The sacred life of Jesus <br/>
In ev'ry step divine.<br/>
Thy soul was His fair garden, <br/>
Thy virgin breast His throne,<br/>
Thy thoughts His faithful mirror,<br/>
Reflecting Him alone.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Lady of the Rosary, <br/>
White roses let us bring, <br/>
And lay them round thy footstool, <br/>
Before our Infant King.<br/>
For, resting in thy bosom, <br/>
God's Son was fain to be<br/>
The child of thy obedience <br/>
And spotless purity. <br/>
