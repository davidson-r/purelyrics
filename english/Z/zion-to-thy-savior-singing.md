<br/>
Zion, to Thy Savior singing,<br/>
To thy Prince and Shepherd bringing,<br/>
Sweetest hymns of love and praise,<br/>
Thou wilt never reach the measure<br/>
Of His worth, by all the treasure<br/>
Of thy most ecstatic lays.<br/>
<br/>
Of all wonders that can thrill thee,<br/>
And, with adoration fill thee,<br/>
What than this can greater be,<br/>
That Himself to thee He giveth?<br/>
He that eateth ever liveth,<br/>
For the Bread of Life is He.<br/>
<br/>
Fill thy lips to overflowing<br/>
With sweet praise, His mercy showing<br/>
Who this heav’nly table spread:<br/>
On this day so glad and holy,<br/>
To each longing spirit lowly<br/>
Giveth He the living Bread.<br/>
<br/>
Here the King hath spread His table,<br/>
Whereon eyes of faith are able<br/>
Christ our Passover to trace:<br/>
Shadows of the law are going,<br/>
Light and life and truth inflowing,<br/>
Night to day is giving place.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, this angels’ food descending<br/>
Heavenly love is hither sending,<br/>
Hungry lips on earth to feed:<br/>
So the paschal lamb was given,<br/>
So the manna came from Heaven,<br/>
Isaac was His type indeed.<br/>
<br/>
O Good Shepherd, Bread life giving,<br/>
Us, Thy grace and life receiving,<br/>
Feed and shelter evermore;<br/>
Thou on earth our weakness guiding,<br/>
We in Heav’n with Thee abiding,<br/>
With all saints will Thee adore.<br/>
