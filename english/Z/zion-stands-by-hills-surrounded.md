<br/>
Zion stands by hills surrounded,<br/>
Zion, kept by power divine;<br/>
All her foes shall be confounded,<br/>
Though the world in arms combine;<br/>
Happy Zion, what a favored lot is thine!<br/>
Happy Zion, what a favored lot is thine!<br/>
<br/>
Every human tie may perish;<br/>
Friend to friend unfaithful prove;<br/>
Mothers cease their own to cherish;<br/>
Heav’n and earth at last remove;<br/>
But no changes can attend Jehovah’s love,<br/>
But no changes can attend Jehovah’s love.<br/>
<br/>
In the furnace God may prove thee,<br/>
Thence to bring thee forth more bright,<br/>
But can never cease to love thee;<br/>
Thou art precious in His sight;<br/>
God is with thee—God, thine everlasting Light,<br/>
God is with thee—God, thine everlasting Light.<br/>
