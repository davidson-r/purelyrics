<br/>
Zion, founded on the mountains,<br/>
God, thy Maker, loves thee well;<br/>
He has chosen thee, most precious,<br/>
He delights in thee to dwell;<br/>
God’s own city, God’s own city,<br/>
God’s own city, who can all thy glory tell?<br/>
<br/>
Heathen lands and hostile peoples<br/>
Soon shall come the Lord to know;<br/>
Nations born again in Zion<br/>
Shall the Lord’s salvation show;<br/>
God Almighty, God Almighty,<br/>
God Almighty, shall on Zion strength bestow.<br/>
<br/>
When the Lord shall count the nations,<br/>
Sons and daughters He shall see,<br/>
Born to endless life in Zion,<br/>
And their joyful song shall be:<br/>
“Blessèd Zion, blessèd Zion,<br/>
Blessèd Zion, all our fountains are in thee.”<br/>
