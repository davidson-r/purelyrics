<br/>
Zion, on the holy hills,<br/>
God, thy Maker, loves thee well;<br/>
All thy courts His presence fills,<br/>
He delights in thee to dwell.<br/>
Wondrous shall Thy glory be,<br/>
City blest of God, the Lord;<br/>
Nations shall be born in thee,<br/>
Unto life from death restored.<br/>
<br/>
When the Lord the names shall write<br/>
Of thy sons, a countless throng,<br/>
God Most High will thee requite,<br/>
He Himself will make thee strong.<br/>
Then in song and joyful mirth<br/>
Shall thy ransomed sons agree,<br/>
Singing forth throughout the earth,<br/>
“All my fountains are in thee.”<br/>
