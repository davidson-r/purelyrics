<br/>
Zion mourns in fear and anguish,<br/>
Zion, city of our God.<br/>
“Ah,” she says, “how sore I languish,<br/>
Bowed beneath the chast’ning rod!<br/>
For my God forsook me quite<br/>
And forgot my sorry plight<br/>
Mid these troubles now distressing,<br/>
Countless woes my soul oppressing.<br/>
<br/>
“Once,” she mourns, “He promised plainly<br/>
That His help should e’er be near;<br/>
Yet I now must seek Him vainly<br/>
In my days of woe and fear.<br/>
Will His anger never cease?<br/>
Will He not renew His peace?<br/>
Will He not show forth compassion<br/>
And again forgive transgression?”<br/>
<br/>
“Zion, surely I do love thee,”<br/>
Thus to her the Savior saith,<br/>
“Tho’ with many woes I prove thee<br/>
And thy soul is sad to death.<br/>
For My troth is pledged to thee;<br/>
Zion, thou art dear to Me.<br/>
Deep within My heart I’ve set thee,<br/>
That I never can forget thee.<br/>
<br/>
“Let not Satan make thee craven;<br/>
He can threaten but not harm.<br/>
On My hands thy name is graven,<br/>
And thy shield is My strong arm.<br/>
How, then, could it ever be<br/>
I should not remember thee,<br/>
Fail to build thy walls, My city,<br/>
And look down on thee with pity?<br/>
<br/>
“Ever shall Mine eyes behold thee;<br/>
On My bosom thou art laid.<br/>
Ever shall My love enfold thee;<br/>
Never shalt thou lack Mine aid.<br/>
Neither Satan, war, nor stress<br/>
Then shall mar thy happiness:<br/>
With this blessèd consolation<br/>
Be thou firm in tribulation.”<br/>
