<br/>
Zion’s King shall reign victorious,<br/>
All the earth shall own His sway;<br/>
He will make His kingdom glorious,<br/>
He will reign through endless day.<br/>
What though none on earth assist Him,<br/>
God requires not help from man;<br/>
What though all the world resist Him,<br/>
God will realize His plan.<br/>
<br/>
Nations now from God estrangèd,<br/>
Then shall see a glorious light,<br/>
Night to day shall then be changèd,<br/>
Heaven shall triumph in the sight;<br/>
See the ancient idols falling!<br/>
Worshipped once, but now abhorred;<br/>
Men on Zion’s King are calling,<br/>
Zion’s King by all adored.<br/>
<br/>
Then shall Israel, long dispersèd,<br/>
Mourning seek the Lord their God,<br/>
Look on Him whom once they piercèd,<br/>
Own and kiss the chastening rod;<br/>
Then all Israel shall be savèd,<br/>
War and tumult then shall cease,<br/>
While the greater Son of David<br/>
Rules a conquered world in peace.<br/>
