title: The Old Rugged Cross

<br/>
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,<br/>
The emblem of suffering and shame;<br/>
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best<br/>
For a world of lost sinners was slain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,<br/>
Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/>
I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/>
And exchange it some day for a crown.<br/>
<br/>
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,<br/>
Has a wondrous attraction for me;<br/>
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above<br/>
To bear it to dark Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,<br/>
A wondrous beauty I see,<br/>
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,<br/>
To pardon and sanctify me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;<br/>
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;<br/>
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,<br/>
Where His glory forever I’ll share.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
