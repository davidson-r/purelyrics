title: Time With An Unwearied Hand

<br/>
Time, with an unwearied hand,<br/>
Pushes round the seasons past,<br/>
And in life’s frail glass, the sand<br/>
Sinks apace, not long to last:<br/>
Many, well as you or I,<br/>
Who last year assembled thus;<br/>
In their silent graves now lie,<br/>
Graves will open soon for us!<br/>
<br/>
Daily sin, and care, and strife,<br/>
While the Lord prolongs our breath,<br/>
Make it but a dying life,<br/>
Or a kind of living death:<br/>
Wretched they, and most forlorn,<br/>
Who no better portion know;<br/>
Better ne’er to have been born,<br/>
Than to have our all below.<br/>
<br/>
When constrained to go alone,<br/>
Leaving all you love behind;<br/>
Entering on a world unknown,<br/>
What will then support your mind?<br/>
When the Lord His summons sends,<br/>
Earthly comforts lose their power;<br/>
Honors, riches, kindred, friends,<br/>
Cannot cheer a dying hour.<br/>
<br/>
Happy souls who fear the Lord<br/>
Time is not too swift for you;<br/>
When your Savior gives the word,<br/>
Glad you’ll bid the world adieu:<br/>
Then He’ll wipe away your tears,<br/>
Near Himself appoint your place;<br/>
Swifter fly, ye rolling years,<br/>
Lord, we long to see Thy face.<br/>
