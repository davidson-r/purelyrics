<br/>
Thou fairest Child divine,<br/>
In yonder manger laid,<br/>
In Whom is God Himself well pleased,<br/>
By Whom all things were made,<br/>
On me art Thou bestowed,<br/>
How can such wonders be!<br/>
The dearest that the Father hath<br/>
He gives me here in Thee!<br/>
<br/>
I was a foe to God,<br/>
I fought in Satan’s host,<br/>
I trifled all His grace away,<br/>
Alas! my soul was lost.<br/>
Yet God forgives my sin,<br/>
His heart, with pity moved,<br/>
He gives me, heavenly Child, in Thee;<br/>
Lo! thus our God hath loved!<br/>
<br/>
Once blind with sin and self,<br/>
Along the treacherous way,<br/>
That ends in ruin at the last,<br/>
I hastened far astray;<br/>
Then God sent down His Son,<br/>
For with a love most deep,<br/>
Most undeserved, His heart still yearned<br/>
O’er me, poor wandering sheep!<br/>
<br/>
God with His life of love<br/>
To me was far and strange,<br/>
My heart clung only to the world<br/>
Of sight and sense and change;<br/>
In Thee, Immanuel,<br/>
Are God and man made one;<br/>
In Thee my heart hath peace with God,<br/>
And union in the Son.<br/>
<br/>
Oh ponder this, my soul,<br/>
Our God hath loved us thus,<br/>
That e’en His only dearest Son<br/>
He freely giveth us.<br/>
Thou precious gift of God,<br/>
The pledge and bond of love,<br/>
With thankful heart I kneel to take<br/>
This treasure from above.<br/>
<br/>
I kneel beside Thy couch,<br/>
I press Thee to my heart,<br/>
For Thee I gladly all forsake<br/>
And from the creature part;<br/>
Thou priceless Pearl! lo, He<br/>
By whom Thou’rt loved and known,<br/>
Will give Himself and all He hath<br/>
To win Thee for His own.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come, Thou blessèd Child,<br/>
Thou Savior of my soul,<br/>
For ever bound to Thee, my name<br/>
Among Thy host enroll.<br/>
O deign to take my heart,<br/>
And let Thy heart be mine,<br/>
That all my love flow out to Thee,<br/>
And lose itself in mine.<br/>
