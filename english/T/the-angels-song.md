Now let us sing the Angel's song<br/>
That rang so sweet and clear,<br/>
When heav'nly light and music fell<br/>
On earthly eye and ear;<br/>
To Him we sing, our Saviour King,<br/>
Who always deigns to hear:<br/>
"Glory to God, and peace on earth."<br/>
<br/>
He came to tell the Father's love,<br/>
His goodness, truth and grace;<br/>
To show the brightness of His smile,<br/>
The glory of His face;<br/>
With His own light, so full and bright,<br/>
The shades of death to chase.<br/>
"Glory to God, and peace on earth."<br/>
<br/>
He came to bright the weary ones<br/>
True peace and perfect rest;<br/>
To take away the guilt and sing<br/>
Which darken'd and distressed,<br/>
That great and small might hear His call,<br/>
And gain we raise on high.<br/>
"Glory to God, and peace on earth."<br/>
<br/>
He came to bring a glorious gift,<br/>
Good will to men; - and why?<br/>
Because He loved us, Jesus came<br/>
For us to live and die;<br/>
Then sweet and long, the Angels' song,<br/>
Again we raise on high.<br/>
"Glory to God, and peace on earth."
