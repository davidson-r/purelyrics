<br/>
Thanks to God for my Redeemer,<br/>
Thanks for all Thou dost provide!<br/>
Thanks for times now but a memory,<br/>
Thanks for Jesus by my side!<br/>
Thanks for pleasant, balmy springtime,<br/>
Thanks for dark and stormy fall!<br/>
Thanks for tears by now forgotten,<br/>
Thanks for peace within my soul!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for prayers that Thou hast answered,<br/>
Thanks for what Thou dost deny!<br/>
Thanks for storms that I have weathered,<br/>
Thanks for all Thou dost supply!<br/>
Thanks for pain, and thanks for pleasure,<br/>
Thanks for comfort in despair!<br/>
Thanks for grace that none can measure,<br/>
Thanks for love beyond compare!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for roses by the wayside,<br/>
Thanks for thorns their stems contain!<br/>
Thanks for home and thanks for fireside,<br/>
Thanks for hope, that sweet refrain!<br/>
Thanks for joy and thanks for sorrow,<br/>
Thanks for heavenly peace with Thee!<br/>
Thanks for hope in the tomorrow,<br/>
Thanks through all eternity!<br/>
