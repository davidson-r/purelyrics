<br/>
Iâ€™ll tell you a tale of the olden time,<br/>
While the yule log burns bright, and the church bells chime.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
There sate a fair princess in joy on her throne,<br/>
And there in her arms her Infant was shown:<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
The beasts of the meadows bowed down their head<br/>
All under the moonlight so softly shed.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
They worshipped the King of Creation there<br/>
In the arms of the mother so passing fair.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
O who are these masters of ancient mould?<br/>
O these are the shepherds, the lords of the fold;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
They have heard from the sky of the birth of their King,<br/>
They have heard all the sky with the harmony ring.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
The kings of the east in number three,<br/>
All worship the Monarch of high degree;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
Their tribute they offer, their heads they bow,<br/>
And clearer and clearer is echoing now,<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
<br/>
For all the zenith is blazing with light,<br/>
And musical voices enrapture the night:<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
O this is the carol of peace and goodwill<br/>
From the voices celestial, the zenith that fill;<br/>
Gloria in excelsis, Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br/>
