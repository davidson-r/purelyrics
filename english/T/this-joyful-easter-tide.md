<br/>
This joyful Easter-tide,<br/>
Away with care and sorrow!<br/>
My Love, the Crucified,<br/>
Hath sprung to life this morrow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Had Christ, that once was slain,<br/>
Ne’er burst His three day prison,<br/>
Our faith had been in vain;<br/>
But now hath Christ arisen,<br/>
Arisen, arisen, arisen!<br/>
<br/>
My flesh in hope shall rest,<br/>
And for a season slumber;<br/>
Till trump from east to west,<br/>
Shall wake the dead in number.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Death’s flood hath lost his chill,<br/>
Since Jesus crossed the river:<br/>
Lover of souls, from ill<br/>
My passing soul deliver.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
