<br/>
To Thee my heart I offer,<br/>
O Christ-child sweet and dear,<br/>
Upon Thy love relying;<br/>
Oh, be Thou ever near!<br/>
Take Thou my heart and give me Thine<br/>
And let it be forever mine,<br/>
O Jesus, holy, undefiled,<br/>
My Savior meek and mild.<br/>
<br/>
My heart within is glowing,<br/>
O Christ-child sweet and dear;<br/>
I love Thee, Lord and Savior,<br/>
Oh, be Thou ever near!<br/>
I see Thee in a manger laid,<br/>
Near cattle resting unafraid;<br/>
I see Thy deep humility<br/>
And lowly bow to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
What brought Thee to the manger,<br/>
O Christ-child sweet and dear?<br/>
Thy love for me, a stranger<br/>
Oh, be Thou ever near!<br/>
O Lord, how great is this Thy love<br/>
That reaches down from Heavâ€™n above,<br/>
Thy love for us, by sin defiled,<br/>
That made Thee, God, a child!<br/>
<br/>
With all my heart and being,<br/>
O Christ-child sweet and dear,<br/>
I love Thee, and Thee only;<br/>
Oh, be Thou ever near!<br/>
My heart I in Thy manger lay;<br/>
Let it remain there and for aye<br/>
Draw it to Thee that it may be<br/>
Secure eternally.<br/>
<br/>
Let me be Thine forever,<br/>
O Christ-child sweet and dear;<br/>
Uphold me with Thy mercy,<br/>
And be Thou ever near.<br/>
From Thee I gladly all receive,<br/>
And what is mine to Thee I give,<br/>
My heart, my soul, and all I own.<br/>
Let these be Thine alone.<br/>
