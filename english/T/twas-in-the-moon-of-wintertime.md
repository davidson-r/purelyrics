<br/>
’Twas in the moon of wintertime,<br/>
When all the birds had fled,<br/>
That mighty Gitchi Manitou<br/>
Sent angel choirs instead;<br/>
Before their light the stars grew dim,<br/>
And wondering hunters heard the hymn:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus your King is born,<br/>
Jesus is born,<br/>
In excelsis gloria.<br/>
<br/>
Within a lodge of broken bark<br/>
The tender babe was found,<br/>
A ragged robe of rabbit skin<br/>
Enwrapped His beauty round;<br/>
But as the hunter braves drew nigh,<br/>
The angel song rang loud and high:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The earliest moon of wintertime<br/>
Is not so round and fair<br/>
As was the ring of glory on<br/>
The helpless Infant there.<br/>
The chiefs from far before Him knelt<br/>
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O children of the forest free,<br/>
O seed of Manitou,<br/>
The holy Child of earth and Heav’n<br/>
Is born today for you.<br/>
Come kneel before the radiant Boy,<br/>
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
