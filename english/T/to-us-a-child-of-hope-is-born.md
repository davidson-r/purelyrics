<br/>
To us a Child of hope is born,<br/>
To us a Son is giv’n,<br/>
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,<br/>
Him all the hosts of Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
His Name shall be the Prince of Peace,<br/>
Forevermore adorned,<br/>
The Wonderful, the Counselor,<br/>
The great and mighty Lord.<br/>
<br/>
His pow’r, increasing, still shall spread,<br/>
His reign no end shall know,<br/>
Justice shall guard His throne above,<br/>
And peace abound below.<br/>
<br/>
To us a Child of hope is born,<br/>
To us a Son is giv’n,<br/>
The Wonderful, the Counselor,<br/>
The mighty Lord of Heav’n.<br/>
