<br/>
Thou gracious Power, whose mercy lends<br/>
The light of home, the smile of friends,<br/>
Our families in Thine arms enfold<br/>
As in the peaceful days of old.<br/>
<br/>
Wilt Thou not hear us while we raise,<br/>
In sweet accord of solemn praise,<br/>
The voices that have mingled long<br/>
In joyous flow of mirth and song?<br/>
<br/>
For all the blessings life has brought,<br/>
For all its sorrowing hours have taught,<br/>
For all we mourn, for all we keep,<br/>
The hands we clasp, the loved that sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The noontide sunshine of the past,<br/>
These brief, bright moments fading fast,<br/>
The stars that gild our darkening years,<br/>
The twilight ray from holier spheres.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee, Father; let Thy grace<br/>
Our narrowing circle still embrace,<br/>
Thy mercy shed its heavenly store,<br/>
Thy peace be with us evermore.<br/>
