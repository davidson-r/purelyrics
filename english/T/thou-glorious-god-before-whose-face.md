title: Thou Glorious God Before Whose Face

<br/>
Thou glorious God, before Whose face<br/>
The generations pass away,<br/>
As, to our eyes, the tender grace<br/>
And marvel of each shining day!<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for the joy sublime<br/>
Of years so radiant with Thy power<br/>
That all the best of endless time<br/>
Seems granted to the fleeting hour.<br/>
<br/>
We praise Thee for the surer right,<br/>
The clearer message from above,<br/>
The lengthening day, the shortening night,<br/>
The wiser ministries of love.<br/>
<br/>
We bless Thee for the friends we miss,<br/>
Who made our peace, and stilled our pain;<br/>
We trust Thee on some height of bliss<br/>
To bring them close to us again.<br/>
<br/>
We magnify Thy holy Name;<br/>
And while in Thee our hearts rejoice,<br/>
Strong be our wills, through praise and blame,<br/>
To do the bidding of Thy voice.<br/>
