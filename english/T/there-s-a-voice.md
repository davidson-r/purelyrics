There’s a voice in the wilderness crying,<br/>
A call from the ways untrod:<br/>
Prepare in the desert a highway,<br/>
A highway for our God!<br/>
The valleys shall be exalted,<br/>
The lofty hills brought low;<br/>
Make straight all the crooked places,<br/>
Where the Lord our God may go!<br/>
<br/>
O Zion, that bringest good tidings,<br/>
Get thee up to the heights and sing!<br/>
Proclaim to a desolate people<br/>
The coming of their King.<br/>
Like the flowers of the field they perish,<br/>
The works of men decay,<br/>
The power and pomp of nations<br/>
Shall pass like a dream away.<br/>
<br/>
But the word of our God endureth,<br/>
The arm of the Lord is strong;<br/>
He stands in the midst of nations,<br/>
And He will right the wrong.<br/>
He shall feed His flock like a shepherd,<br/>
And fold the lambs to His breast;<br/>
In pastures of peace He’ll lead them,<br/>
And give to the weary rest.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a voice in the wilderness crying,<br/>
A call from the ways untrod:<br/>
Prepare in the desert a highway,<br/>
A highway for our God!<br/>
The valleys shall be exalted,<br/>
The lofty hills brought low;<br/>
Make straight all the crooked places,<br/>
Where the Lord our God may go!
