This child we dedicate to Thee,<br/>
O God of grace and purity!<br/>
Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,<br/>
And let Thy love its life prolong.<br/>
<br/>
O may Thy Spirit gently draw<br/>
Its willing soul to keep Thy law;<br/>
May virtue, piety, and truth,<br/>
Dawn even with its dawning youth!<br/>
<br/>
We, too, before Thy gracious sight<br/>
Once shared the blest baptismal rite,<br/>
And would renew its solemn vow,<br/>
With love, and thanks, and praises now.<br/>
<br/>
Grant that, with true and faithful heart,<br/>
We still may act the Christian’s part,<br/>
Cheered by each promise Thou hast giv’n,<br/>
And laboring for the prize in Heav’n.
