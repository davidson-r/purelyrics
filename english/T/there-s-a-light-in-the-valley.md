title: Theres A Light In The Valley

<br/>
Through the valley of the shadow I must go,<br/>
Where the cold waves of Jordan roll;<br/>
But the promise of my Shepherd I will know,<br/>
Be the rod and the staff to my soul.<br/>
Even now down the valley as I glide,<br/>
I can hear my Savior say, “Follow me!”<br/>
And with Him I’m not afraid to cross the tide;<br/>
There’s a light in the valley for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There’s a light in the valley,<br/>
There’s a light in the valley,<br/>
There’s a light in the valley for me,<br/>
And no evil will I fear while my Shepherd is so near,<br/>
There’s a light in the valley for me.<br/>
<br/>
Now the rolling of the billows I can hear,<br/>
As they beat on the turf bound shore;<br/>
But the beacon light of love so bright and clear,<br/>
Guides my bark, frail and lone, safely over.<br/>
I shall find down the valley no alarms,<br/>
For my Savior’s blessed smile I can see;<br/>
He will bear me in His loving, mighty arms,<br/>
There’s a light in the valley for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
