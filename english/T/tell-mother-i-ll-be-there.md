<br/>
When I was but a little child how well I recollect<br/>
How I would grieve my mother with my folly and neglect;<br/>
And now that she has gone to Heav’n I miss her tender care:<br/>
O Savior, tell my mother, I’ll be there!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell mother I’ll be there, in answer to her prayer;<br/>
This message, blessèd Savior, to her bear!<br/>
Tell mother I’ll be there, Heav’n’s joys with her to share;<br/>
Yes, tell my darling mother I’ll be there.<br/>
<br/>
Though I was often wayward, she was always kind and good;<br/>
So patient, gentle, loving when I acted rough and rude;<br/>
My childhood griefs and trials she would gladly with me share:<br/>
O Savior, tell my mother, I’ll be there!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When I became a prodigal, and left the old rooftree,<br/>
She almost broke her loving heart in mourning after me;<br/>
And day and night she prayed to God to keep me in His care:<br/>
O Savior, tell my mother, I’ll be there!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
One day a message came to me, it bade me quickly come<br/>
If I would see my mother ere the Savior took her home;<br/>
I promised her, before she died, for Heaven to prepare:<br/>
O Savior, tell my mother, I’ll be there!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
