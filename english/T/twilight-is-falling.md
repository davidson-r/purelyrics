<br/>
Twilight is falling over the sea,<br/>
Shadows are stealing dark on the lea;<br/>
Borne on the night winds, voices of yore<br/>
Come from the far off shore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Far away beyond the starlit skies,<br/>
Where the love-light never, never dies,<br/>
Gleameth a mansion, filled with delight,<br/>
Sweet happy home so bright!<br/>
<br/>
Voices of loved ones, songs of the past,<br/>
Still linger round me while life shall last;<br/>
Lonely I wander, sadly I roam,<br/>
Seeking that far off home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Come in the twilight, come, come to me!<br/>
Bringing some message over the sea,<br/>
Cheering my pathway while here I roam,<br/>
Seeking that far off home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
