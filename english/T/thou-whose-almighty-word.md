<br/>
Thou, Whose almighty Word<br/>
Chaos and darkness heard,<br/>
And took their flight;<br/>
Hear us, we humbly pray,<br/>
And, where the Gospel’s day<br/>
Sheds not its glorious ray,<br/>
Let there be light!<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Who didst come to bring<br/>
On Thy redeeming wing<br/>
Healing and sight,<br/>
Health to the sick in mind,<br/>
Sight to the inly blind,<br/>
O now, to all mankind,<br/>
Let there be light!<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of truth and love,<br/>
Life giving, holy Dove,<br/>
Speed forth Thy flight;<br/>
Move on the water’s face<br/>
Bearing the lamp of grace,<br/>
And, in earth’s darkest place,<br/>
Let there be light!<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd and holy Three,<br/>
Glorious Trinity,<br/>
Wisdom, love, might!<br/>
Boundless as ocean’s tide,<br/>
Rolling in fullest pride,<br/>
Through the world far and wide,<br/>
Let there be light!<br/>
