<br/>
The Lord Whom earth and stars and sea<br/>
With one adoring voice resound,<br/>
Who rules them all in majesty,<br/>
In Mary's heart a cloister found. <br/>
<br/>
O Mother, blessed by God's command,<br/>
The Lord Who made the earth and sky<br/>
And holds the world within His hand,<br/>
Within your body deigned to lie. <br/>
<br/>
O Mother by the angel blessed,<br/>
Made fruitful by the Spirit's grace,<br/>
Within your womb He took His rest,<br/>
Awaited by the human race. <br/>
<br/>
Eternal glory to the Son<br/>
Who came to earth through Mary pure,<br/>
With Father and with Spirit one,<br/>
While endless ages yet endure.Â  <br/>
