<br/>
The race that long in darkness pined,<br/>
Have seen a glorious Light;<br/>
The people dwell in day, who dwelt<br/>
In death’s surrounding night.<br/>
<br/>
To hail Thy rise, Thou better Sun,<br/>
The gathering nations come,<br/>
Joyous as when the reapers bear<br/>
The harvest treasures home.<br/>
<br/>
For Thou our burden hast removed,<br/>
And quelled the oppressor’s sway,<br/>
Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell<br/>
In Midian’s evil day.<br/>
<br/>
To us a Child of Hope is born,<br/>
To us a Son is given,<br/>
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,<br/>
Him all the hosts of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
His Name shall be the Prince of Peace,<br/>
Forevermore adored,<br/>
The Wonderful, the Counselor,<br/>
The great and mighty Lord.<br/>
<br/>
His power increasing still shall spread,<br/>
His reign no end shall know:<br/>
Justice shall guard His throne above,<br/>
And peace abound below.<br/>
