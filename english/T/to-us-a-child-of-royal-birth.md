<br/>
To us a Child of royal birth,<br/>
Heir of the promises, is given;<br/>
The Invisible appears on earth,<br/>
The Son of man, the God of heaven.<br/>
<br/>
A Saviour born, in love supreme<br/>
He comes our fallen souls to raise;<br/>
He comes His people to redeem<br/>
With all His plenitude of grace.<br/>
<br/>
The Christ, by raptured seers foretold,<br/>
Filled with the eternal Spiritâ€™s power,<br/>
Prophet, and Priest, and King behold,<br/>
And Lord of all the worlds adore.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord of hosts, the God most high,<br/>
Who quits His throne on earth to live,<br/>
With joy we welcome from the sky,<br/>
With faith into our hearts receive.<br/>
