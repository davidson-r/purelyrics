title: The Manger Throne

<center>
Like silver lamps in a distant shrine,<br/>
The stars are sparkling bright<br/>
The bells of the city of God ring out,<br/>
For the Son of Mary is born to-night.<br/>
The gloom is past<br/>
And the morn at last<br/>
Is coming with orient light.<br/>
<br/>
No earthly songs are half so sweet<br/>
As those which are filling the skies,<br/>
And never a palace shone half so fair<br/>
As the manger-bed where our Saviour lies;<br/>
No night in the year<br/>
Is half so dear<br/>
As this which has ended our sighs.<br/>
<br/>
The stars of heaven still shine as at first<br/>
They gleamed on this wonderful night;<br/>
The bells of the city of God peal out<br/>
And the angels' song still rings in the height,<br/>
And love still turns<br/>
Where the Godhead burns<br/>
Hid in flesh from fleshly sight.<br/>
<br/>
Faith sees no longer the stable floor,<br/>
The pavement of sapphire is there<br/>
The clear light of heaven streams out to the world<br/>
And the angels of God are crowding the air,<br/>
And heaven and earth<br/>
Through the spotless birth<br/>
Are at peace on this night so fair.
