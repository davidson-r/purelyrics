<br/>
Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son;<br/>
Endless is the victory, Thou o’er death hast won;<br/>
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,<br/>
Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thine is the glory, risen conqu’ring Son,<br/>
Endless is the vict’ry, Thou o’er death hast won.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;<br/>
Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;<br/>
Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing;<br/>
For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life;<br/>
Life is naught without Thee; aid us in our strife;<br/>
Make us more than conqu’rors, through Thy deathless love:<br/>
Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
