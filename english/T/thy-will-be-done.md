<br/>
Out of earth’s heart breaking sorrow and anguish<br/>
Into eternity’s rapture and calm;<br/>
Out of the doubts and the fears where we languish<br/>
Into the triumph of victory’s psalm;<br/>
Gone is a leader and friend of the people,<br/>
Home with the ransomed and numberless throngs,<br/>
There to receive the reward of his labors,<br/>
Who in the ranks of the martyrs belongs.<br/>
Whisper it tenderly sorrowing one,<br/>
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.<br/>
This was God’s way, this was God’s way,<br/>
This was God’s way, His will ever be done.<br/>
<br/>
Out of the battle of life sorely wounded<br/>
Into the joy of the victory won;<br/>
Now face to face with his King and Commander<br/>
His the promotion for what he has done;<br/>
Ours the loss of a true standard bearer,<br/>
His the bright crown and eternal reward,<br/>
Called from earth’s strife to become a blest sharer,<br/>
Now and henceforth in the joy of the Lord.<br/>
Lovingly, tenderly, joyfully say,<br/>
His will be done, we believe ’tis God’s way.<br/>
His will be done, His will be done,<br/>
His will be done, We believe ’tis God’s way.<br/>
<br/>
Out of the noise and the tumult of battle<br/>
Into the rest and the infinite peace;<br/>
Out of earth’s bondage and wearisome exile<br/>
Into the joy of the spirit’s release;<br/>
Ours the loss and the grief beyond measure,<br/>
Confidence broken and hopes crushed for aye,<br/>
Lord God of hosts if it be Thy good pleasure,<br/>
Help us to trust and believe ’tis Thy way.<br/>
Like him for whom we know Heav’n is begun,<br/>
We would say earnestly, His will be done.<br/>
His will be done, His will be done,<br/>
This is God’s way, His will ever be done.<br/>
