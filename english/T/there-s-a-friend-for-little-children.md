<br/>
There’s a Friend for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
A Friend who never changes,<br/>
Whose love will never die;<br/>
Our earthly friends may fail us,<br/>
And change with changing years,<br/>
This Friend is always worthy<br/>
Of that dear Name He bears.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a rest for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
Who love the blessèd Savior,<br/>
And to the Father cry<br/>
A rest from every turmoil,<br/>
From sin and sorrow free,<br/>
Where every little pilgrim<br/>
Shall rest eternally.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a home for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
Where Jesus reigns in glory,<br/>
A home of peace and joy<br/>
No home on earth is like it,<br/>
Nor can with it compare;<br/>
For everyone is happy<br/>
Nor could be happier there.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a crown for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
And all who look for Jesus<br/>
Shall wear it by and by;<br/>
A crown of brightest glory,<br/>
Which He will then bestow<br/>
On those who found his favor<br/>
And loved His Name below.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a song for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
A song that will not weary,<br/>
Though sung continually;<br/>
A song which even angels<br/>
Can never, never sing<br/>
They know not Christ as Savior,<br/>
But worship Him as King.<br/>
<br/>
There’s a robe for little children<br/>
Above the bright blue sky,<br/>
And a harp of sweetest music,<br/>
And palms of victory.<br/>
All, all above is treasured,<br/>
And found in Christ alone:<br/>
O come, dear little children<br/>
That all may be your own.<br/>
