<center>
Ten thousand times ten thousand in sparkling raiment bright,<br/>
The armies of the ransomed saints throng up the steeps of light;<br/>
’Tis finished, all is finished, their fight with death and sin;<br/>
Fling open wide the golden gates, and let the victors in.<br/>
<br/>
What rush of alleluias fills all the earth and sky!<br/>
What ringing of a thousand harps bespeaks the triumph nigh!<br/>
O day, for which creation and all its tribes were made;<br/>
O joy, for all its former woes a thousandfold repaid!<br/>
<br/>
O then what raptured greetings on Canaan’s happy shore;<br/>
What knitting severed friendships up, where partings are no more!<br/>
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle, that brimmed with tears of late;<br/>
Orphans no longer fatherless, nor widows desolate.<br/>
<br/>
Bring near Thy great salvation, Thou Lamb for sinners slain;<br/>
Fill up the roll of Thine elect, then take Thy power, and reign;<br/>
Appear, Desire of nations, Thine exiles long for home;<br/>
Show in the heaven Thy promised sign; Thou Prince and Savior, come.
