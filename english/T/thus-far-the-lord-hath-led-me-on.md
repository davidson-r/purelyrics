title: Thus Far The Lord Hath Led Me On

<br/>
Thus far the Lord hath led me on,<br/>
Thus far His power prolongs my days,<br/>
And every evening shall make known<br/>
Some fresh memorial of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
Much of my time has run to waste,<br/>
And I, perhaps, am near my home;<br/>
But He forgives my follies past,<br/>
And gives me strength for days to come.<br/>
<br/>
I lay my body down to sleep;<br/>
Peace is the pillow for my head;<br/>
While well appointed angels keep<br/>
Their watchful stations round my bed.<br/>
<br/>
In vain the sons of earth or hell<br/>
Tell me a thousand frightful things<br/>
My God in safety makes me dwell<br/>
Beneath the shadow of His wings.<br/>
<br/>
Faith in His Name forbids my fear;<br/>
O may Thy presence neâ€™er depart!<br/>
And in the morning make me hear<br/>
The love and kindness of Thy heart.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when the night of death shall come,<br/>
My flesh shall rest beneath the ground,<br/>
And wait Thy voice to rouse my tomb,<br/>
With sweet salvation in the sound.<br/>
