<center>
Thy little ones, dear Lord, are we,<br/>
And come Thy lowly bed to see;<br/>
Enlighten every soul and mind,<br/>
That we the way to Thee may find.<br/>
<br/>
With songs we hasten Thee to greet,<br/>
And kiss the dust before Thy feet;<br/>
O blessèd hour, O sweetest night,<br/>
That gave Thee birth, our soul’s delight.<br/>
<br/>
O draw us wholly to Thee, Lord,<br/>
Do Thou to us Thy grace accord,<br/>
True faith and love to us impart,<br/>
That we may hold Thee in our heart.<br/>
<br/>
Until at last we too proclaim<br/>
With all Thy saints, Thy glorious Name;<br/>
In paradise our songs renew,<br/>
And praise Thee as the angels do.
