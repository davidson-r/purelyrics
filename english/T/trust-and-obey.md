<br/>
When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,<br/>
What a glory He sheds on our way!<br/>
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,<br/>
And with all who will trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way<br/>
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,<br/>
But His smile quickly drives it away;<br/>
Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear,<br/>
Can abide while we trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,<br/>
But our toil He doth richly repay;<br/>
Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,<br/>
But is blessed if we trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
But we never can prove the delights of His love<br/>
Until all on the altar we lay;<br/>
For the favor He shows, for the joy He bestows,<br/>
Are for them who will trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.<br/>
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way.<br/>
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;<br/>
Never fear, only trust and obey.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
