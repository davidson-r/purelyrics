<br/>
’Tis done! that new and heavenly birth,<br/>
Which re-creates the sons of earth,<br/>
Has cleansed from guilt of Adam’s sin<br/>
A soul which Jesus died to win.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis done! the cross upon the brow<br/>
Is marked for weal or sorrow now,<br/>
To shine with heavenly luster bright,<br/>
Or burn in everlasting night.<br/>
<br/>
O ye who came that babe to lay<br/>
Within a Savior’s arms today,<br/>
Watch well and guard with careful eye<br/>
The heir of immortality.<br/>
<br/>
Teach him to know a Father’s love,<br/>
And seek for happiness above,<br/>
To Christ his heart and treasures give<br/>
And in the Spirit ever live.<br/>
<br/>
That so before the judgment seat<br/>
In joy and triumph ye may meet;<br/>
The battle fought, the struggle o’er,<br/>
The kingdom yours forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow,<br/>
Praise Him, all creatures here below,<br/>
Praise Him above, angelic host,<br/>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br/>
