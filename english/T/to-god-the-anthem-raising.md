<br/>
To God the anthem raising,<br/>
Sing, Christians, great and small;<br/>
Sing out, His goodness praising,<br/>
Oh, thank Him, one and all!<br/>
Behold how God this year,<br/>
Which now is safely ended,<br/>
Hath in His love befriended<br/>
His children far and near.<br/>
<br/>
Let us consider rightly<br/>
His mercies manifold,<br/>
And let us not think lightly<br/>
Of all His gifts untold.<br/>
Let thankfulness recall<br/>
How God this year hath led us,<br/>
How He hath clothed and fed us,<br/>
The great ones and the small.<br/>
<br/>
To church and state He granted<br/>
His peace in every place,<br/>
His vineyard He hath planted<br/>
Among us by His grace,<br/>
His ever bounteous hand<br/>
Prosperity hath given<br/>
And want and famine driven<br/>
From this our native land.<br/>
<br/>
His Father heart is yearning<br/>
To take us for His own<br/>
When, our transgressions mourning,<br/>
We trust in Christ alone;<br/>
When in His Name we pray<br/>
And humbly make confession,<br/>
He pardons our transgression<br/>
And is our faithful Stay.<br/>
<br/>
Our God hath well defended,<br/>
Hath kept us through His grace;<br/>
But if He had contended<br/>
With us our sins to trace<br/>
And given us our meed,<br/>
We all would then be lying<br/>
In sin and sorrow, dying,<br/>
Each one for his misdeed.<br/>
<br/>
O Father dear in Heaven,<br/>
For all Thy gifts of love<br/>
Which Thou to us hast given<br/>
We lift our thanks above.<br/>
In Jesusâ€™ Name we here,<br/>
To Thee our prayers addressing,<br/>
Still ask Thee for Thy blessing:<br/>
Grant us a joyful year.<br/>
