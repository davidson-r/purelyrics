<br/>
He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts<br/>
Rest assured this troubador is acting on his part.<br/>
The union of your spirits, here, has caused him to remain<br/>
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name<br/>
There is love. there is love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home<br/>
And they shall travel on to where the two shall be as one.<br/>
As it was in the beginning is now and til the end<br/>
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again.<br/>
And there is love. there is love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife?<br/>
Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life?<br/>
And if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for?<br/>
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?<br/>
Oh there's love, there is love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused him to remain<br/>
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in his name<br/>
There is love. there is love. <br/>
