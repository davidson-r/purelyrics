Thanks for Thy Word, O blessèd Redeemer!<br/>
Open our eyes its beauty to see;<br/>
Grant us Thy grace to study it wisely,<br/>
Close every heart to all but Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Bible, off’ring so freely<br/>
Pardon and peace to all who believe;<br/>
Help us, O Lord, its counsel to follow,<br/>
Meekly by faith its truth receive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for Thy Word of precept and promise,<br/>
Lamp to our feet and light to our way,<br/>
Points us afar where pleasures immortal<br/>
Bloom in Thine own bright realm of day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd are they who keep its commandments,<br/>
They shall abide for ever with Thee;<br/>
Close by the clear and beautiful river,<br/>
Sharing the fruits of life’s fair tree.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
