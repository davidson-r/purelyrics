<br/>
They all were looking for a king<br/>
To slay their foes and lift them high;<br/>
Thou cam’st a little Baby thing<br/>
That made a woman cry.<br/>
<br/>
O Son of Man, to right my lot<br/>
Naught but Thy presence can avail;<br/>
Yet on the road Thy wheels are not,<br/>
Nor on the sea Thy sail.<br/>
<br/>
My fancied ways why should’st Thou heed?<br/>
Thou com’st down Thine own secret stair;<br/>
Com’st down to answer all my need,<br/>
Yes, every bygone prayer.<br/>
