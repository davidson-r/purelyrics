<br/>
Â Last night I lay a-sleeping<br/>
There came a dream so fair,<br/>
I stood in old Jerusalem<br/>
Beside the temple there.<br/>
I heard the children singing,<br/>
And ever as they sang,<br/>
Me thought the voice of angels<br/>
From heaven in answer rang.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br/>
Lift up your gates and sing,<br/>
Hosanna in the highest!<br/>
Hosanna to your King!<br/>
<br/>
And then me thought my dream was changed,<br/>
The streets no longer rang,<br/>
Hushed were the glad Hosannas<br/>
The little children sang.<br/>
The sun grew dark with mystery,<br/>
The morn was cold and chill,<br/>
As the shadow of a cross arose<br/>
Upon a lonely hill.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br/>
Hark! How the angels sing,<br/>
Hosanna in the highest!<br/>
Hosanna to your King!<br/>
<br/>
And once again the scene was changed;<br/>
New earth there seemed to be;<br/>
I saw the Holy City<br/>
Beside the tideless sea;<br/>
The light of God was on its streets,<br/>
The gates were open wide,<br/>
And all who would might enter,<br/>
And no one was denied.<br/>
No need of moon or stars by night,<br/>
Or sun to shine by day;<br/>
It was the new Jerusalem<br/>
That would not pass away.<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem!<br/>
Sing for the night is o'er!<br/>
Hosanna in the highest!<br/>
Hosanna for evermore!<br/>
