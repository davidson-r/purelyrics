Wassail! wassail! all over the town,<br/>
Our toast it is white and our ale it is brown;<br/>
Our bowl it is made of the white maple tree;<br/>
With the wassailing bowl , we'll drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to our horse, and to his right ear,<br/>
God send our master a happy new year:<br/>
A happy new year as e'er he did see,<br/>
With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
So here is to Cherry and to his right cheek<br/>
Pray God send our master a good piece of beef<br/>
And a good piece of beef that may we all see<br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to our mare, and to her right eye,<br/>
God send our mistress a good Christmas pie;<br/>
A good Christmas pie as e'er I did see,<br/>
With my wassailing bowl I drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
So here is to Broad Mary and to her broad horn<br/>
May God send our master a good crop of corn<br/>
And a good crop of corn that may we all see<br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
And here is to Fillpail and to her left ear<br/>
Pray God send our master a happy New Year<br/>
And a happy New Year as e'er he did see<br/>
With the wassailing bowl, we'll drink to thee.<br/>
<br/>
Here's to our cow , and to her long tail,<br/>
God send our master us never may fail<br/>
Of a cup of good beer : I pray you draw near,<br/>
And our jolly wassail it's then you shall hear.<br/>
<br/>
Come butler, come fill us a bowl of the best<br/>
Then we hope that your soul in heaven may rest<br/>
But if you do draw us a bowl of the small<br/>
Then down shall go butler, bowl and all.<br/>
<br/>
Be here any maids? I suppose here be some;<br/>
Sure they will not let young men stand on the cold stone!<br/>
Sing hey O, maids! come trole back the pin,<br/>
And the fairest maid in the house let us all in.<br/>
<br/>
Then here's to the maid in the lily white smock<br/>
Who tripped to the door and slipped back the lock<br/>
Who tripped to the door and pulled back the pin<br/>
For to let these jolly wassailers in.
