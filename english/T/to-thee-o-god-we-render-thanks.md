title: To Thee O God We Render Thanks

<br/>
To thee, O God, we render thanks,<br/>
We render thanks to thee;<br/>
Because thy wondrous works declare<br/>
Thy great name near to be.<br/>
<br/>
I purpose when I shall receive<br/>
The congregation, Lord,<br/>
That I will judgment uprightly<br/>
To every one award.<br/>
<br/>
The land has been dissolved throughout,<br/>
With all that in it dwell,<br/>
But yet its pillars I bear up,<br/>
And them establish well.<br/>
<br/>
I to the foolish people said,<br/>
Do not deal foolishly;<br/>
And unto those that wicked are,<br/>
Lift not your horn on high.<br/>
<br/>
Lift not your horn on high, nor speak<br/>
With stubborn neck; but know,<br/>
Promotion not from east, nor west,<br/>
Nor from the south doth flow.<br/>
<br/>
But God is judge, he puts down one,<br/>
And sets another up.<br/>
For in the hands of God Most High<br/>
Of red wine is a cup;<br/>
<br/>
'Tis full of mixture; he pours forth,<br/>
And makes the wicked all<br/>
Wring out the bitter dregs thereof;<br/>
Yea, and they drink them shall.<br/>
<br/>
But I forever will exult,<br/>
I Jacob's God will praise.<br/>
All power of sinners will cut off;<br/>
But just men's power will raise.<br/>
