title: This Is My Fathers World

<br/>
This is my Father's world, <br/>
and to my listening ears <br/>
all nature sings, and round me rings <br/>
the music of the spheres. <br/>
This is my Father's world: <br/>
I rest me in the thought <br/>
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas; <br/>
his hand the wonders wrought.<br/>
<br/>
This is my Father's world, <br/>
the birds their carols raise, <br/>
the morning light, the lily white, <br/>
declare their maker's praise. <br/>
This is my Father's world: <br/>
he shines in all that's fair; <br/>
in the rustling grass I hear him pass; <br/>
he speaks to me everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
This is my Father's world. <br/>
O let me ne'er forget <br/>
that though the wrong seems oft so strong, <br/>
God is the ruler yet. <br/>
This is my Father's world: <br/>
why should my heart be sad? <br/>
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring! <br/>
God reigns; let the earth be glad!<br/>
