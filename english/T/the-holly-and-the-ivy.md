<br/>
The holly and the ivy,<br/>
When they are both full grown<br/>
Of all the trees that are in the wood<br/>
The holly bears the crown<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir<br/>
<br/>
The holly bears a blossom<br/>
As white as lily flower<br/>
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
To be our sweet Saviour<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir<br/>
<br/>
The holly bears a berry<br/>
As red as any blood<br/>
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
To do poor sinners good<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir<br/>
<br/>
The holly bears a prickle<br/>
As sharp as any thorn;<br/>
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
On Christmas Day in the morn.<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir<br/>
<br/>
The holly bears a bark<br/>
As bitter as any gall;<br/>
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
For to redeem us all.<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir<br/>
<br/>
The holly and the ivy<br/>
Now both are full well grown,<br/>
Of all the trees that are in the wood,<br/>
The holly bears the crown.<br/>
O the rising of the sun<br/>
And the running of the deer<br/>
The playing of the merry organ<br/>
Sweet singing of the choir.<br/>
