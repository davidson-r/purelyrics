<br/>
Thou Who roll’st the year around,<br/>
Crowned with mercies large and free,<br/>
Rich Thy gifts to us abound;<br/>
Warm our praise shall rise to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Kindly to our worship bow<br/>
While our grateful thanks we tell,<br/>
That, sustained by Thee, we now<br/>
Bid the parting year farewell.<br/>
<br/>
All its numbered days are sped,<br/>
All its busy scenes are o’er,<br/>
All its joys forever fled,<br/>
All its sorrows felt no more.<br/>
<br/>
Mingled with th’eternal past,<br/>
Its remembrance shall decay,<br/>
Yet to be revived at last<br/>
At the solemn Judgment Day.<br/>
<br/>
All our follies, Lord, forgive;<br/>
Cleanse us from each guilty stain.<br/>
Let Thy grace within us live<br/>
That we spend not years in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when life’s last eve shall come,<br/>
Happy spirits, may we fly<br/>
To our everlasting home,<br/>
To our Father’s house on high!<br/>
