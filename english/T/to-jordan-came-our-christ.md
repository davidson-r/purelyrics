title: To Jordan Came Our Christ

To Jordan came our Lord the Christ,<br/>
To do God’s pleasure willing,<br/>
And there was by Saint John baptized,<br/>
All righteousness fulfilling;<br/>
There did He consecrate a bath<br/>
To wash away transgression,<br/>
And quench the bitterness of death<br/>
By His own blood and passion;<br/>
He would a new life give us.<br/>
<br/>
So hear ye all, and well perceive<br/>
What God doth call baptism,<br/>
And what a Christian should believe<br/>
Who error shuns and schism:<br/>
That we should water use, the Lord<br/>
Declareth it His pleasure;<br/>
Not simple water, but the Word<br/>
And Spirit without measure;<br/>
He is the true Baptizer.<br/>
<br/>
To show us this, He hath His Word<br/>
With signs and symbols given;<br/>
On Jordan’s banks was plainly heard<br/>
The Father’s voice from Heaven:<br/>
“This is My well-beloved Son,<br/>
In whom My soul delighteth;<br/>
Hear Him.” Yea, hear Him every one<br/>
Whom He Himself inviteth,<br/>
Hear and obey His teaching.<br/>
<br/>
In tender manhood Jesus straight<br/>
To holy Jordan wendeth;<br/>
The Holy Ghost from Heaven’s gate<br/>
In dovelike shape descendeth;<br/>
That thus the truth be not denied,<br/>
Nor should our faith e’er waver,<br/>
That the Three Persons all preside,<br/>
At baptism’s holy laver,<br/>
And dwell with the believer.<br/>
<br/>
Thus Jesus His disciples sent:<br/>
Go teach ye every nation,<br/>
That lost in sin they must repent;<br/>
And flee from condemnation:<br/>
He that believes and is baptized,<br/>
Obtains a mighty blessing;<br/>
A new-born man, no more he dies,<br/>
Eternal life possessing,<br/>
A joyful heir of Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Who in this mercy hath not faith,<br/>
Nor aught therein discerneth,<br/>
Is yet in sin, condemned to death,<br/>
And fire that ever burneth;<br/>
His holiness avails him not,<br/>
Nor aught which he is doing;<br/>
His inborn sin brings all to naught,<br/>
And maketh sure his ruin;<br/>
Himself he cannot succor.<br/>
<br/>
The eye of sense alone is dim,<br/>
And nothing sees but water;<br/>
Faith sees Christ Jesus, and in Him<br/>
The Lamb ordained for slaughter;<br/>
She sees the cleansing fountain red<br/>
With the dear blood of Jesus,<br/>
Which from the sins inherited<br/>
From fallen Adam frees us,<br/>
And from our own misdoings.
