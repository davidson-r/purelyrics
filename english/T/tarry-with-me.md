<br/>
Tarry with me, O my Savior,<br/>
For the day is passing by;<br/>
See! the shades of evening gather,<br/>
And the night is drawing nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Deeper, deeper grow the shadows,<br/>
Paler now the glowing west,<br/>
Swift the night of death advances;<br/>
Shall it be the night of rest?<br/>
<br/>
Lonely seems the vale of shadow;<br/>
Sinks my heart with troubled fear;<br/>
Give me faith for clearer vision,<br/>
Speak Thou, Lord, in words of cheer.<br/>
<br/>
Let me hear Thy voice behind me,<br/>
Calming all these wild alarms;<br/>
Let me, underneath my weakness,<br/>
Feel the everlasting arms.<br/>
<br/>
Feeble, trembling, fainting, dying,<br/>
Lord, I cast myself on Thee;<br/>
Tarry with me through the darkness;<br/>
While I sleep, still watch by me.<br/>
<br/>
Tarry with me, O my Savior,<br/>
Lay my head upon Thy breast<br/>
Till the morning; then awake meâ€”<br/>
Morning of eternal rest.<br/>
