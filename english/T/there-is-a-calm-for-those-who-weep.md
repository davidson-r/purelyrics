title: There Is A Calm For Those Who Weep

<br/>
There is a calm for those who weep,<br/>
A rest for weary pilgrims found;<br/>
They safely lie and sweetly sleep,<br/>
Low in the ground, low in the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The storms that sweep the wintry sky<br/>
No more disturb their deep repose,<br/>
Than summer evening’s latest sigh<br/>
That shuts the rose, that shuts the rose.<br/>
<br/>
Thy soul renewed by grace divine,<br/>
In God’s own image, freed from clay,<br/>
In Heav’n’s eternal sphere shall shine,<br/>
A star of day, a star of day.<br/>
