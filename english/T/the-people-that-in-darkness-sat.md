<br/>
The people that in darkness sat<br/>
A glorious light have seen;<br/>
The light has shined on them who long<br/>
In shades of death have been, <br/>
In shades of death have been.<br/>
<br/>
To hail you, Sun of Righteous, <br/>
The gathering nations come;<br/>
They joy as when the reapers bear<br/>
Their harvest treasures home,<br/>
Their harvest treasures home.<br/>
<br/>
To us the Child of hope is born, <br/>
To us the Son is given,<br/>
And on his shoulder ever rests<br/>
All power in earth and heaven,<br/>
All power in earth and heaven.<br/>
<br/>
His name shall be the Prince of Peace,<br/>
The Everlasting Lord,<br/>
The Wonderful, the Counselor,<br/>
The God by all adored,<br/>
The God by all adored.<br/>
<br/>
His righteous government and power<br/>
Shall over all extend;<br/>
On judgment and on justice based,<br/>
His reign shall have no end,<br/>
His reign shall have no end.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus, reign is us, we pray,<br/>
And make us yours alone,<br/>
Who with the Father ever are <br/>
And Holy spirit, one,<br/>
And Holy spirit, one.<br/>
