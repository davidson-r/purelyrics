title: To My Humble Supplication

<br/>
To my humble supplication,<br/>
Lord, give ear and acceptation;<br/>
Save Thy servant, that hath none<br/>
Help nor hope but Thee alone.<br/>
<br/>
Send, O send, relieving gladness<br/>
To my soul oppressed with sadness,<br/>
Which, from clog of earth set free,<br/>
Winged with zeal, flies up to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee, rich in merciesâ€™ treasure,<br/>
And in goodness without measure,<br/>
Never failing help to those<br/>
Who on Thy sure help repose.<br/>
<br/>
Heavenly Tutor, of Thy kindness,<br/>
Teach my dullness, guide my blindness,<br/>
That my steps Thy paths may tread,<br/>
Which to endless bliss do lead.<br/>
