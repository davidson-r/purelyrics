title: Think O Lord In Mercy

<br/>
Think, O Lord, in mercy on the souls of those<br/>
Who, in faith gone from us, now in death repose.<br/>
Here ’mid stress and conflict toils can never cease;<br/>
There, the warfare ended, bid them rest in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Often were they wounded in the deadly strife;<br/>
Heal them, Good Physician, with the balm of life.<br/>
Every taint of evil, frailty and decay,<br/>
Good and gracious Savior, cleanse and purge away.<br/>
<br/>
Rest eternal grant them, after weary fight;<br/>
Shed on them the radiance of Thy heav’nly light.<br/>
Lead them onward, upward, to the holy place,<br/>
Where Thy saints, made perfect, gaze upon Thy face.<br/>
