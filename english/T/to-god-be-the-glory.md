To God be the glory! great things he hath done!<br/>
So loved he the world that he gave us his son,<br/>
Who yielded his life an atonement for sin,<br/>
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>
Let the earth hear his voice!<br/>
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br/>
Let the people rejoice!<br/>
O come to the father through Jesus the son;<br/>
And give him the glory - great things he hath done.<br/>
<br/>
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!<br/>
To every believer the promise of God;<br/>
The vilest offender who truly believes,<br/>
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,<br/>
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son:<br/>
But purer and higher and greater will be<br/>
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
