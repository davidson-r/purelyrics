<br/>
To Thee, O God, the shepherd kings<br/>
Their earliest homage paid,<br/>
And wafted upon angel wings<br/>
Their worship was conveyed.<br/>
<br/>
And they who “watched their flocks by night”<br/>
Were first to learn Thy grace,<br/>
Were first to seek by dawning light,<br/>
Their Savior’s dwelling place.<br/>
<br/>
The hills and vales, the woods and streams,<br/>
The fruits and flowers, are Thine;<br/>
Where’er the sun can send its beams<br/>
Or the mild moon can shine.<br/>
<br/>
By Thee, the spring puts forth its leaves,<br/>
By Thee, comes down the rain,<br/>
By Thee, the yellow harvest sheaves<br/>
Stand ripening on the plain.<br/>
<br/>
When winter comes in storm and wrath,<br/>
Thy soothing voice is heard;<br/>
As round the farmer’s peaceful hearth<br/>
Is read Thy holy Word.<br/>
<br/>
Thus are we fostered by Thy care,<br/>
Supported by Thy hand;<br/>
Our heritage is rich and fair,<br/>
And this Thy chosen land.<br/>
