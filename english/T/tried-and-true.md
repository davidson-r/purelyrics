<br/>
We are a band of merry children,<br/>
Full of glee, full of glee,<br/>
Like the springtime in its beauty,<br/>
Glad are we, glad are we;<br/>
Bright is the busy world around us,<br/>
Bright with flowers, bright with flowers,<br/>
Smiles from the sunny vale above us,<br/>
Come with the hours, come with the hours.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are a band of merry, merry children,<br/>
While to the Sunday school we cling,<br/>
We are a band of merry, merry children,<br/>
Tried and true, tried and true.<br/>
<br/>
Happy am I, the bird is singing,<br/>
Wild and free, wild and free,<br/>
While to the song with hearts we echo,<br/>
So are we, so are we;<br/>
O! there is joy in every blossom,<br/>
We may share, we may share,<br/>
While we adore the hand that made it,<br/>
Pure and fair, pure and fair.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Happy am I, the wind is sighing,<br/>
Through the shade, through the shade;<br/>
Sweet is my home the daisy murmurs,<br/>
In the glade, in the glade;<br/>
Thus we can say in days of childhood,<br/>
Full of glee, full of glee,<br/>
Blending our hearts with natureâ€™s voices,<br/>
Blest are we, blest are we.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
