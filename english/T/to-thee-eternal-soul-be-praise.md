<br/>
To Thee, Eternal Soul, be praise!<br/>
Who, from of old to our own days,<br/>
Through souls of saints and prophets, Lord,<br/>
Hast sent Thy light, Thy love, Thy Word.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for each mighty one<br/>
Through whom Thy living light hath shone;<br/>
And for each humble soul and sweet<br/>
That lights to heaven our wandering feet.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for the love divine<br/>
Made real in every saint of Thine;<br/>
That boundless love itself that gives<br/>
In service to each soul that lives.<br/>
<br/>
We thank Thee for the Word of might<br/>
Thy Spirit spake in darkest night.<br/>
Spake through the trumpet voices loud<br/>
Of prophets at Thy throne who bowed.<br/>
<br/>
Eternal Soul, our souls keep pure,<br/>
That like Thy saints we may endure;<br/>
Forever through Thy servants, Lord,<br/>
Send Thou Thy light, Thy love, Thy Word.<br/>
