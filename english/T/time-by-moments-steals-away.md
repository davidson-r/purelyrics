title: Time By Moments Steals Away

<center>
Time, by moments, steals away,<br/>
First the hour, and then the day;<br/>
Small the daily loss appears,<br/>
Yet it soon amounts to years:<br/>
Thus another year is flown,<br/>
Now it is no more our own<br/>
(If it brought or promised good)<br/>
Than the years before the flood.<br/>
<br/>
But (may none of us forget)<br/>
It has left us much in debt;<br/>
Favors from the Lord received,<br/>
Sins that have His Spirit grieved;<br/>
Marked by an unerring hand<br/>
In His book recorded stand;<br/>
Who can tell the vast amount,<br/>
Placed to each of our account?<br/>
<br/>
Happy, the believing soul!<br/>
Christ for you has paid the whole;<br/>
While you own the debt is large,<br/>
You may plead a full discharge:<br/>
But poor careless sinner, say,<br/>
What can you to justice pay?<br/>
Tremble, lest when life is past,<br/>
Into prison you be cast!<br/>
<br/>
Will you still increase the score?<br/>
Still be careless, as before?<br/>
O, forbid it, gracious Lord,<br/>
Touch their spirits by Thy Word!<br/>
Now, in mercy, to them show<br/>
What a mighty debt they owe!<br/>
All their unbelief subdue,<br/>
Let them find forgiveness too.<br/>
<br/>
Spared to see another year,<br/>
Let Thy blessing meet us here;<br/>
Come, Thy dying work revive,<br/>
Bid Thy drooping garden thrive:<br/>
Sun of righteousness arise!<br/>
Warm our hearts, and bless our eyes;<br/>
Let our prayer Thy bowels move,<br/>
Make this year a time of love!
