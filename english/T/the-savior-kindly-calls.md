title: The Savior Kindly Calls

<center>
The Savior kindly calls<br/>
Our children to His breast;<br/>
He folds them in His gracious arms,<br/>
Himself declares them blest.<br/>
<br/>
“Let them approach,” He cries,<br/>
“Nor scorn their humble claim;<br/>
The heirs of Heav'n are such as these,<br/>
For such as these I came.”<br/>
<br/>
With joy we bring them, Lord,<br/>
Devoting them to Thee,<br/>
Imploring that, as we are Thine,<br/>
Thine may our offspring be.
</center>
