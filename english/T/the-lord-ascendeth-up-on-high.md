<center>
The Lord ascendeth up on high,<br/>
The Lord hath triumphed gloriously,<br/>
In power and might excelling;<br/>
The grave and hell are captive led,<br/>
Lo! He returns, our glorious Head,<br/>
To His eternal dwelling.<br/>
<br/>
The heavens with joy receive their Lord,<br/>
By saints, by angel hosts adored,<br/>
O day of exultation!<br/>
O earth, adore thy glorious King!<br/>
His rising, His ascension sing<br/>
With grateful adoration!<br/>
<br/>
Our great High Priest hath gone before,<br/>
Now on His Church His grace to pour,<br/>
And still His love He giveth;<br/>
O may our hearts to Him ascend;<br/>
May all within us upward tend<br/>
To Him Who ever liveth!
