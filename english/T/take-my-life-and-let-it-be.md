title: Take My Life And Let It Be

<br/>
Take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to Thee.<br/>
Take my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise.<br/>
Take my hands, and let them move at the impulse of Thy love.<br/>
Take my feet, and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Take my voice, and let me sing always, only, for my King.<br/>
Take my lips, and let them be filled with messages from Thee.<br/>
Take my silver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold.<br/>
Take my intellect, and use every power as Thou shalt choose.<br/>
<br/>
Take my will, and make it Thine; it shall be no longer mine.<br/>
Take my heart, it is Thine own; it shall be Thy royal throne.<br/>
Take my love, my Lord, I pour at Thy feet its treasure store.<br/>
Take myself, and I will be ever, only, all for Thee.<br/>
