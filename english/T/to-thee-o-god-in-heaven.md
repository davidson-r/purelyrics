<br/>
To Thee, O God in Heaven,<br/>
This little one we bring;<br/>
Giving to Thee what Thou hast givâ€™n,<br/>
Our dearest offering.<br/>
<br/>
Into a world of toil<br/>
These little feet will roam,<br/>
Where sin its purity may soil,<br/>
Where care and grief may come.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let Thy Word of Love,<br/>
With influence serene,<br/>
Come down, like water, from above,<br/>
To comfort and make clean!<br/>
