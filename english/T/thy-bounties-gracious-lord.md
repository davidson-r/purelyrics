title: Thy Bounties Gracious Lord

<center>
Thy bounties, gracious Lord,<br/>
With gratitude we own;<br/>
We bless Thy providential grace,<br/>
Which show’rs its blessings down.<br/>
<br/>
With joy the people bring<br/>
Their off’rings round Thy throne;<br/>
With thankful souls, behold, we pay<br/>
A tribute of Thine own.<br/>
<br/>
O may this sacrifice<br/>
To Thee, the Lord, ascend,<br/>
An odor of sweet perfume,<br/>
Presented by His hand.
