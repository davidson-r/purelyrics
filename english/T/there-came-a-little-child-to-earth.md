<br/>
There came a little Child to earth<br/>
Long ago;<br/>
And the angels of God proclaimed His birth,<br/>
High and low.<br/>
<br/>
Out on the night, so calm and still,<br/>
Their song was heard;<br/>
For they knew that the Child on Bethlehemâ€™s hill<br/>
Was Christ the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Far away in the goodly land<br/>
Fair and bright;<br/>
Children with crowns of glory stand,<br/>
Robed in white.<br/>
<br/>
They sing, the Lord of Heaven so fair,<br/>
A Child was born;<br/>
And that they might His crown of glory share,<br/>
Wore crown of thorn.<br/>
<br/>
In mortal weakness, want and pain,<br/>
He came to die,<br/>
That the children of earth might in glory reign<br/>
With Him on high.<br/>
<br/>
And evermore in robes so fair<br/>
And undefiled,<br/>
Those ransomed children His praise declare,<br/>
Who was a Child.<br/>
