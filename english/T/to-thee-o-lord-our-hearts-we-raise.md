title: To Thee O Lord Our Hearts We Raise

<center>
<br/>
To thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise <br/>
in hymns of adoration,<br/>
to thee bring sacrifice of praise <br/>
with shouts of exultation.<br/>
Bright robes of gold the fields adorn, <br/>
the hills with joy are ringing,<br/>
the valleys stand so thick with corn <br/>
that even they are singing.<br/>
<br/>
And now, on this our festal day, <br/>
thy bounteous hand confessing,<br/>
Upon thine altar, Lord, we lay <br/>
the first fruits of thy blessing.<br/>
By thee the souls of men are fed<br/>
with gifts of grace supernal;<br/>
thou, who dost give us earthly bread, <br/>
give us the bread eternal.<br/>
<br/>
We bear the burden of the day, <br/>
and often toil seems dreary;<br/>
but labor ends with sunset ray, <br/>
and rest comes for the weary.<br/>
May we, the angel reaping over, <br/>
stand at the last accepted,<br/>
Christ's golden sheaves, forevermore <br/>
to garners bright elected.<br/>
<br/>
O blessèd is that land of God <br/>
where saints abide forever,<br/>
where golden fields spread fair and broad, <br/>
where flows the crystal river;<br/>
the strains of all its holy throng <br/>
with ours today are blending;<br/>
thrice blessèd is that harvest song <br/>
which never hath an ending. <br/>
