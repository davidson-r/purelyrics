title: There Is A Pure And Tranquil Wave

<center>
<br/>
There is a pure and tranquil wave,<br/>
That issues from the throne of grace;<br/>
Whose waters gladden as they lave<br/>
The bright and heav’nly dwelling place.<br/>
<br/>
In living streams behold that tide,<br/>
Thro’ Christ, the Rock, profusely burst,<br/>
And in His Word behold supplied,<br/>
The fount for which our spirits thirst.<br/>
<br/>
The pilgrim, faint, who seems to sink<br/>
Beneath the sultry sky of time,<br/>
May here repose and freely drink<br/>
The waters of that better clime.<br/>
