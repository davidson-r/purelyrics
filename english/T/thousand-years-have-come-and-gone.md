<br/>
A thousand years have come and gone, and near a thousand more,<br/>
Since happier light from heaven shone than ever shone before:<br/>
And in the hearts of old and young a joy most joyful stirred.<br/>
That sent such news from tongue to tongue as ears had never heard.<br/>
<br/>
Then angels on their starry way felt bliss unfelt before,<br/>
For news that men should be as they to darkened earth they bore;<br/>
So toiling men and spirits bright a first communion had,<br/>
And in meek mercyâ€™s rising light were each exceeding glad.<br/>
<br/>
And we are glad, and we will sing, as in the days of yore;<br/>
Come all, and hearts made ready bring, to welcome back once more<br/>
The day when first on wintry earth a summer change began,<br/>
And, dawning in a lowly birth uprose the Light of man.<br/>
<br/>
For trouble such as men must bear from childhood to fourscore,<br/>
He shared with us, that we might share His joy forevermore;<br/>
And twice a thousand years of grief of conflict, and of sin,<br/>
May tell how large the harvest sheaf His patient love shall win.<br/>
