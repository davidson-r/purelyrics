title: Thou didst leave Thy throne

<br/>
Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,<br/>
When Thou camest to earth for me;<br/>
But in Bethlehem’s home was there found no room<br/>
For Thy holy nativity.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br/>
There is room in my heart for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven’s arches rang when the angels sang,<br/>
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;<br/>
But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth,<br/>
And in great humility.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The foxes found rest, and the birds their nest<br/>
In the shade of the forest tree;<br/>
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,<br/>
In the deserts of Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word,<br/>
That should set Thy people free;<br/>
But with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn,<br/>
They bore Thee to Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When the heav’ns shall ring, and her choirs shall sing,<br/>
At Thy coming to victory,<br/>
Let Thy voice call me home, saying “Yet there is room,<br/>
There is room at My side for thee.”<br/>
<br/>
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,<br/>
When Thou comest and callest for me.<br/>
