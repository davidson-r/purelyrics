<br/>
This night a wondrous revelation<br/>
Makes known to me God’s love and grace;<br/>
The Child that merits adoration<br/>
Brings light to our benighted race;<br/>
And though a thousand suns did shine,<br/>
Still brighter were that Light divine.<br/>
<br/>
The Sun of Grace for thee is beaming;<br/>
Rejoice, my soul, in Jesus’ birth!<br/>
The light from yonder manger streaming<br/>
Sends forth its rays o’er all the earth.<br/>
It drives the night of sin away<br/>
And turns our darkness into day.<br/>
<br/>
This Light, which all thy gloom can banish,<br/>
The bliss of heaven glorifies;<br/>
When sun and moon and stars shall vanish,<br/>
Its rays shall still illume the skies.<br/>
This light through all eternity<br/>
Thy heaven and all to thee shall be.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, precious Sun of Gladness,<br/>
Fill Thou my soul with light, I pray.<br/>
Dispel the gloomy night of sadness<br/>
And teach Thou me this Christmas Day<br/>
How I a child of light may be,<br/>
Aglow with light that comes from Thee.<br/>
