title: Thou Art gone up on High

<center>
<br/>
Thou art gone up on high, to mansions in the skies;<br/>
And round Thy throne unceasingly the songs of praise arise;<br/>
But we are lingering here, with sin and care oppressed;<br/>
Lord, send Thy promised Comforter, and lead us to Thy rest.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art gone up on high; but Thou didst first come down,<br/>
Through earthâ€™s most bitter misery to pass unto Thy crown;<br/>
And girt with griefs and fears our onward course must be;<br/>
But only let this path of tears lead us at last to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art gone up on high; but Thou shalt come again,<br/>
With all the bright ones of the sky attendant in Thy train.<br/>
Lord, by Thy saving power so make us live and die,<br/>
That we may stand in that dread hour at Thy right hand on high.<br/>
