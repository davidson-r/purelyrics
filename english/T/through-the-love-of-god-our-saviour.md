<br/>
Through the love of God our Saviour,<br/>
All will be well,<br/>
Free and changeless is His favour;<br/>
All, all is well.<br/>
Precious is the blood that healed us,<br/>
Perfect is the grace that sealed us,<br/>
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us,<br/>
All must be well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though we pass through tribulation.<br/>
All will be well,<br/>
Ours is such a full salvation;<br/>
All, all is well.<br/>
Happy, still in God confiding,<br/>
Fruitful, if in Christ abiding,<br/>
Holy, through the Spirit’s guiding,<br/>
All must be well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We expect a bright to-morrow;<br/>
All will be well,<br/>
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,<br/>
All, all is well.<br/>
On our Father’s love relying,<br/>
Christ our every need supplying,<br/>
Whether living now, or dying,<br/>
All must be well.<br/>
