<br/>
The king of love my shepherd is,<br/>
Whose goodness faileth never;<br/>
I nothing lack if I am his<br/>
And he is mine for ever.<br/>
<br/>
Where streams of living water flow<br/>
My ransomed soul he leadeth,<br/>
And where the verdant pastures grow<br/>
With food celestial feedeth.<br/>
<br/>
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,<br/>
But yet in love he sought me,<br/>
And on his shoulder gently laid,<br/>
And home rejoicing brought me.<br/>
<br/>
In death's dark vale I fear no ill<br/>
With thee, dear Lord, beside me;<br/>
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,<br/>
Thy cross before to guide me.<br/>
<br/>
Thou spread'st a table in my sight;<br/>
Thy unction grace bestoweth;<br/>
And O what transport of delight<br/>
From thy pure chalice floweth!<br/>
<br/>
And so through all the length of days<br/>
Thy goodness faileth never:<br/>
Good shepherd, may I sing thy praise<br/>
Within thy house for ever.<br/>
