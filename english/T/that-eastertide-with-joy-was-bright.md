That Eastertide with joy was bright,<br/>
The sun shone out with fairer light,<br/>
When, to their longing eyes restored,<br/>
The glad apostles saw their Lord.<br/>
<br/>
He bade them see His hands, His side,<br/>
Where yet the glorious wounds abide;<br/>
The tokens true which made it plain<br/>
Their Lord indeed was risen again.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, the King of gentleness,<br/>
Do Thou Thyself our hearts possess<br/>
That we may give Thee all our days<br/>
The tribute of our grateful praise.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord of all, with us abide<br/>
In this our joyful Eastertide;<br/>
From every weapon death can wield<br/>
Thine own redeemed forever shield.<br/>
<br/>
All praise be Thine, O risen Lord,<br/>
From death to endless life restored;<br/>
All praise to God the Father be<br/>
And Holy Ghost eternally.
