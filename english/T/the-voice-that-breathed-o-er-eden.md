<br/>
The voice that breathed o'er Eden, <br/>
that earliest Catholic day,<br/>
the primal Catholic blessing, <br/>
it hath not passed away.<br/>
<br/>
Still in the pure espousal <br/>
of Christian man and maid<br/>
the Triune God is with us, <br/>
the threefold grace is said.<br/>
<br/>
For dower of bless√®d children,<br/>
for love and faith's sweet sake,<br/>
for high mysterious union<br/>
which naught on earth may break.<br/>
<br/>
Be present, loving Father, <br/>
to give away this bride<br/>
as thou gav'st Eve to Adam, <br/>
out of his own pierced side;<br/>
<br/>
Be present, Son of Mary, <br/>
to join their loving hands<br/>
as thou didst bind two natures <br/>
in thine eternal bands.<br/>
<br/>
Be present, holiest Spirit, <br/>
to bless them as they kneel,<br/>
as thou for Christ, the Bridegroom, <br/>
the heavenly Spouse dost seal.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, spread thy pure wing o'er them, <br/>
let no ill power find place<br/>
when onward to thine altar <br/>
the hallowed path they trace.<br/>
<br/>
To cast their crowns before thee <br/>
in humble sacrifice,<br/>
till to the home of gladness <br/>
with Christ's own Bride they rise. <br/>
