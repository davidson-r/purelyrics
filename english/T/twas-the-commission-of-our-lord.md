<br/>
’Twas the commission of our Lord,<br/>
“Go teach the nations, and baptize:”<br/>
The nations have received the word<br/>
Since He ascended to the skies.<br/>
<br/>
He sits upon th’eternal hills,<br/>
With grace and pardon in His hands;<br/>
And sends His cov’nant with the seals,<br/>
To bless the distant darkened lands.<br/>
[originally …the distant British lands]<br/>
<br/>
“Repent, and be baptized,” He saith,<br/>
“For the remission of your sins:”<br/>
And thus our sense assists our faith,<br/>
And shows us what His Gospel means.<br/>
<br/>
Our souls He washes in His blood,<br/>
As water makes the body clean;<br/>
And the good Spirit from our God<br/>
Descends like purifying rain.<br/>
<br/>
Thus we engage ourselves to Thee,<br/>
And seal our cov’nant with the Lord;<br/>
O may the great eternal Three<br/>
In Heav’n our solemn vows record!<br/>
