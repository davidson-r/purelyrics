title: The Wassail Song

<center>
Here we come a-wassailing<br/>
Among the leaves so green,<br/>
Here we come a-wand'ring<br/>
So fair to be seen.<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>
We are not daily beggers<br/>
That beg from door to door,<br/>
But we are neighbors' children<br/>
Whom you have seen before<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>
Good master and good mistress,<br/>
As you sit beside the fire,<br/>
Pray think of us poor children<br/>
Who wander in the mire.<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year<br/>
<br/>
We have a little purse<br/>
Made of ratching leather skin;<br/>
We want some of your small change<br/>
To line it well within.<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>
Bring us out a table<br/>
And spread it with a cloth;<br/>
Bring us out a cheese,<br/>
And of your Christmas loaf.<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>
God bless the master of this house,<br/>
Likewise the mistress too;<br/>
And all the little children<br/>
That round the table go.<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
And to you your wassail, too,<br/>
And God bless you, and send you<br/>
A Happy New Year,<br/>
And God send you a Happy New Year.
