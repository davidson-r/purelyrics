<br/>
The triumphs of the saints,<br/>
The toils they bravely bore,<br/>
The love that never faints,<br/>
Their glory evermore<br/>
For these the Church today<br/>
Pours forth her joyous lay;<br/>
What victors wear so rich a bay?<br/>
<br/>
This clinging world of ill<br/>
Them and their works abhorred;<br/>
Its withering flowers still<br/>
They spurned with one accord;<br/>
They knew them short lived all,<br/>
How soon they fade and fall,<br/>
And followed, Jesu, at Thy call.<br/>
<br/>
What tongue may here declare,<br/>
Fancy or thought descry,<br/>
The joys Thou dost prepare<br/>
For these Thy saints on high?<br/>
Empurpled in the flood<br/>
Of their victorious blood,<br/>
They won the laurel from their God.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord most high, we pray,<br/>
Stretch forth Thy mighty arm<br/>
To put our sins away<br/>
And shelter us from harm;<br/>
O give Thy servants peace;<br/>
From guilt and pain release;<br/>
Our praise to Thee shall never cease.<br/>
