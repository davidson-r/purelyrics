<br/>
Tell me the old, old story of unseen things above,<br/>
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.<br/>
Tell me the story simply, as to a little child,<br/>
For I am weak and weary, and helpless and defiled.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story,<br/>
Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in,<br/>
That wonderful redemption, God’s remedy for sin.<br/>
Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon;<br/>
The early dew of morning has passed away at noon.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell me the story softly, with earnest tones and grave;<br/>
Remember I’m the sinner whom Jesus came to save.<br/>
Tell me the story always, if you would really be,<br/>
In any time of trouble, a comforter to me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell me the same old story when you have cause to fear<br/>
That this world’s empty glory is costing me too dear.<br/>
Yes, and when that world’s glory is dawning on my soul,<br/>
Tell me the old, old story: “Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
