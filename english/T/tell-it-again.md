title: Tell It Again

<center>
<br/>
Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay,<br/>
Dying alone at the close of the day,<br/>
News of salvation we carried; said he:<br/>
“Nobody ever has told it to me!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell it again! Tell it again!<br/>
Salvation’s story repeat o’er and o’er.<br/>
Till none can say of the children of men,<br/>
“Nobody ever has told me before.”<br/>
<br/>
“Did He so love me, a poor little boy?<br/>
Send unto me the good tidings of joy?<br/>
Need I not perish? My hand will He hold?<br/>
Nobody ever the story has told!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Bending we caught the last words of his breath,<br/>
Just as he entered the valley of death:<br/>
“God sent His Son! ‘Whosoever,’ said He:<br/>
Then I am sure that He sent Him for me!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Smiling he said, as his last sigh he spent,<br/>
“I am so glad that for me He was sent!”<br/>
Whispered, while low sunk the sun in the west,<br/>
“Lord, I believe, tell it now to the rest!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
