<br/>
Thou hast said, exalted Jesus,<br/>
“Take thy cross and follow Me”;<br/>
Shall the word with terror seize us?<br/>
Shall we from the burden flee?<br/>
Lord, I’ll take it, Lord, I’ll take it,<br/>
And rejoicing, follow Thee.<br/>
<br/>
While this liquid tomb surveying,<br/>
Emblem of my Savior’s grave,<br/>
Shall I shun its brink, betraying<br/>
Feelings worthy of a slave?<br/>
No, I’ll enter, no, I’ll enter;<br/>
Jesus entered Jordan’s wave.<br/>
<br/>
Blest the sign which thus reminds me,<br/>
Savior, of Thy love for me;<br/>
But more blest the love that binds me<br/>
In its deathless bonds to Thee;<br/>
Oh, what pleasure, oh, what pleasure,<br/>
Buried with my Lord to be!<br/>
<br/>
Fellowship with Him possessing,<br/>
Let me die to earth and sin;<br/>
Let me rise t’enjoy the blessing<br/>
Which the faithful soul shall win;<br/>
May I ever, may I ever<br/>
Follow where my Lord has been.<br/>
