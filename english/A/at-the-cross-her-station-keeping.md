<br/>
At the cross her station keeping,<br/>
stood the mournful mother weeping, <br/>
close to Jesus at the last,<br/>
Through her soul, of joy bereavèd,<br/>
bowed with anguish, deeply grievèd,<br/>
now at length the sword hath passed.<br/>
<br/>
O, that blessed one, grief-laden,<br/>
blessed Mother, blessed Maiden,<br/>
Mother of the all-holy One;<br/>
O that silent, ceaseless mourning,<br/>
O those dim eyes, never turning<br/>
from that wondrous, suffering Son.<br/>
<br/>
Who, on Christ's dear mother gazing,<br/>
in her trouble so amazing,<br/>
born of woman, would not weep?<br/>
Who, on Christ's dear Mother thinking,<br/>
such a cup of sorrow drinking,<br/>
would not share her sorrows deep?<br/>
<br/>
For his people's sins, in anguish,<br/>
there she saw the victim languish,<br/>
bleed in torments, bleed and die.<br/>
Saw the Lord's anointed taken,<br/>
saw her Child in death forrsaken,<br/>
heard his last expiring cry.<br/>
<br/>
In the passion of my Maker,<br/>
be my sinful soul partaker,<br/>
may I bear with her my part;<br/>
of his passion bear the token,<br/>
in a spirit bowed and broken<br/>
bear his death within my heart.<br/>
<br/>
May his wounds both wound and heal me,<br/>
he enkindle, cleanse, and heal me,<br/>
be his cross my hope and stay.<br/>
May he, when the mountains quiver,<br/>
from that flame which burns for ever<br/>
shield me on the judgment day.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, may thy cross defend me,<br/>
and thy saving death befriend me,<br/>
cherished by thy deathless grace:<br/>
when to dust my dust returneth,<br/>
grant a soul that to thee yearneth<br/>
in thy paradise a place. <br/>
