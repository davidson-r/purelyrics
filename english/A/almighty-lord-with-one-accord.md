<br/>
Almighty Lord, with one accord<br/>
We offer Thee our youth,<br/>
And pray that Thou would’st give us<br/>
The warfare of the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Thy cause doth claim our souls by name,<br/>
Because that we are strong;<br/>
In all the land, one steadfast band,<br/>
May we to Christ belong.<br/>
<br/>
Let fall on every college hall<br/>
The luster of Thy cross,<br/>
That love may dare Thy work to share<br/>
And count all else as loss.<br/>
<br/>
Our hearts be ruled, our spirits schooled<br/>
Alone Thy will to seek;<br/>
And when we find Thy blessèd mind,<br/>
Instruct our lips to speak.<br/>
