A day, a day of glory!<br/>
A day that ends our woe!<br/>
A day that tells of triumph<br/>
Against our vanquish'd foe!<br/>
Yield, summer's brightest sunrise,<br/>
To this December morn:<br/>
Life up your gates, ye Princes<br/>
And let the Child be born!<br/>
<br/>
With Gloria in excelsis<br/>
Archangels tell their mirth:<br/>
With Kyrie eleyson<br/>
Men answer upon the earth:<br/>
And angels swell the triumph,<br/>
And mortals raise the horn,<br/>
Life up you gates, ye Princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born.<br/>
<br/>
He comes, His throne the manger;<br/>
He comes, His shrine the stall;<br/>
The ox and ass His courtiers,<br/>
Who made and governs all:<br/>
The "House of Bread" His birth place,<br/>
The Prince of wine and corn:<br/>
Lift up your gates, ye Princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born.<br/>
<br/>
Then bar the gates, that henceforth<br/>
None thus may passage win,<br/>
Because the Prince of Israel<br/>
Alone hath entered in:<br/>
The earth, the sky, the ocean<br/>
His glorious way adorn:<br/>
Lift up your gates, ye Princes,<br/>
And let the Child be born.
