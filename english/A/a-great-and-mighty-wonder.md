<br/>
A great and mighty wonder<br/>
Our Christmas festal brings:<br/>
On earth a lowly infant,<br/>
Behold the King of kings!<br/>
<br/>
The Word is made incarnate,<br/>
Descending from on high;<br/>
And cherubim sing anthems<br/>
To shepherds from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
And we with them, triumphant,<br/>
Repeat the hymn again:<br/>
"To God on high be glory,<br/>
And peace on earth to men!"<br/>
<br/>
While thus they sing your Monarch,<br/>
Those bright angelic bands,<br/>
Rejoice, ye vales and mountains!<br/>
Ye oceans, clap your hands!<br/>
<br/>
Since all He comes to ransom,<br/>
By all be He adored;<br/>
The Infant born in Bethlehem,<br/>
The Savior and the Lord!<br/>
<br/>
And idol forms shall perish,<br/>
And error shall decay,<br/>
And Christ shall wield His scepter,<br/>
Our Lord and God for aye.<br/>
