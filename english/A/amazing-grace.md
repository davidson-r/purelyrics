<br/>
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound<br/>
That saved a wretch like me!<br/>
I once was lost, but now am found;<br/>
Was blind, but now I see.<br/>
<br/>
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br/>
And grace my fears relieved;<br/>
How precious did that grace appear<br/>
The hour I first believed.<br/>
<br/>
Through many dangers, toils and snares,<br/>
I have already come;<br/>
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br/>
And grace will lead me home.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord has promised good to me,<br/>
His word my hope secures;<br/>
He will my shield and portion be,<br/>
As long as life endures.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br/>
And mortal life shall cease,<br/>
I shall possess, within the veil,<br/>
A life of joy and peace.<br/>
<br/>
The world shall soon dissolve like snow,<br/>
The sun refuse to shine;<br/>
But God, who called me here below,<br/>
Shall be forever mine.<br/>
<br/>
When we've been there ten thousand years,<br/>
Bright shining as the sun,<br/>
We've no less days to sing God's praise<br/>
Than when we'd first begun. <br/>
