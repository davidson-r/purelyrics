<center>
All hail to the Prince of Life,<br/>
All hail to the Lord divine!<br/>
For over the whole glad earth<br/>
His glorious light shall shine!<br/>
He comes from the tomb of night,<br/>
The shadow of death laid by,<br/>
He comes as a Conqueror comes,<br/>
His banner of light on high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All hail to the Prince of Life!<br/>
Hosanna to Him we sing<br/>
He comes as a mighty Victor,<br/>
He comes as a conq’ring King!<br/>
<br/>
Go forward ye sons of men<br/>
And welcome the glorious King!<br/>
Go meet Him with songs of joy<br/>
That over His path shall ring!<br/>
He brings from the grave of death<br/>
The blessing of life and peace,<br/>
Who seeks Him shall find a part<br/>
In joys that shall never cease.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then come with your hearts of love<br/>
And come with your songs of praise,<br/>
For Christ Who hath ris’n indeed<br/>
Your anthems of vict’ry raise!<br/>
For never in ages past<br/>
And never in coming years<br/>
Shall Victor and Monarch rise<br/>
Like Him Whom the world reveres.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
