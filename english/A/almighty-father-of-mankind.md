Almighty Father of mankind,<br/>
On Thee our hopes remain;<br/>
And when the day of trouble comes<br/>
I shall not trust in vain.<br/>
<br/>
In early years Thou wast my Guide,<br/>
And of my youth the Friend;<br/>
And as my days began with Thee,<br/>
With Thee my days shall end.<br/>
<br/>
I know the Power in Whom I trust,<br/>
The arm on which I lean;<br/>
He will my Savior ever be<br/>
Who has my Savior been.<br/>
<br/>
My God, Who causedst me to hope<br/>
When life began to beat,<br/>
And, when a stranger in the world,<br/>
Didst guide my wandering feet.<br/>
<br/>
Thou wilt not cast me off when age<br/>
And evil days descend;<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in despair<br/>
To mourn my latter end.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore in life Iâ€™ll trust in Thee,<br/>
In death I will adore;<br/>
And after death will sing Thy praise<br/>
When time shall be no more.
