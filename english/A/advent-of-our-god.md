<br/>
The advent of our God<br/>
Our prayers must now employ,<br/>
And we must meet Him on His road<br/>
With hymns of holy joy.<br/>
<br/>
The everlasting Son<br/>
Incarnate deigns to be;<br/>
Himself a servant’s form puts on<br/>
To set His people free.<br/>
<br/>
Daughter of Zion, rise<br/>
To meet thy lowly King,<br/>
Nor let thy faithless heart despise<br/>
The peace He comes to bring.<br/>
<br/>
As Judge, on clouds of light,<br/>
He soon will come again,<br/>
And all His scattered saints unite<br/>
With Him in Heaven to reign.<br/>
<br/>
Before the dawning day<br/>
Let sin’s dark deeds be gone;<br/>
The old man all be put away,<br/>
The new man all put on.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Son<br/>
Who comes to set us free,<br/>
With Father, Spirit, ever One,<br/>
Through all eternity.<br/>
