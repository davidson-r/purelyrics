Angels we have heard on high<br/>
Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,<br/>
And the mountains in reply<br/>
Echoing their joyous strains.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br/>
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br/>
<br/>
Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br/>
Why your joyous strains prolong?<br/>
What the gladsome tidings be<br/>
Which inspire your heavenly song?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Come to Bethlehem and see<br/>
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;<br/>
Come, adore on bended knee,<br/>
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
See Him in a manger laid,<br/>
Whom the choirs of angels praise;<br/>
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,<br/>
While our hearts in love we raise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
