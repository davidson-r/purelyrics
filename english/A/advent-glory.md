<center>
The day is fast approaching when the Savior shall appear,<br/>
And every eye His glory shall behold;<br/>
The tokens of His coming fill the loyal heart with cheer<br/>
Though strife abounds and love is waxing cold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’ll see Him as He is,<br/>
And the brightness of His glory we shall share;<br/>
We’ll see Him as He is,<br/>
And the likeness of His image we shall bear.<br/>
<br/>
In all His Father’s glory, clothed in majesty unveiled,<br/>
With myriads of the shining angel band,<br/>
The King descends triumphant in whose might we have prevailed,<br/>
And all the ransomed rise at His command.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, may we all as sons of light be watching unto prayer,<br/>
For surely our redemption draweth nigh;<br/>
With holy zeal and patient faith, let every soul prepare<br/>
To join the advent chorus in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
