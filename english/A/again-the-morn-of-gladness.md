<br/>
Again the morn of gladness,<br/>
The morn of light, is here;<br/>
And earth itself looks fairer,<br/>
And Heaven itself more near;<br/>
The bells, like angel voices,<br/>
Speak peace to every breast;<br/>
And all the land lies quiet<br/>
To keep the day of rest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory be to Jesus,<br/>
Let all His children say;<br/>
He rose again, He rose again,<br/>
On this glad day.<br/>
<br/>
Again, O loving Savior,<br/>
The children of Thy grace<br/>
Prepare themselves to seek Thee<br/>
Within Thy chosen place.<br/>
Our song shall rise to greet Thee,<br/>
If Thou our hearts wilt raise;<br/>
If Thou our lips wilt open,<br/>
Our mouth shall show Thy praise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The shining choir of angels<br/>
That rest not day or night,<br/>
The crowned and palm-decked martyrs,<br/>
The saints arrayed in white,<br/>
The happy lambs of Jesus,<br/>
In pastures fair above,<br/>
These all adore and praise Him,<br/>
Whom we, too, praise and love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The Church on earth rejoices<br/>
To join with these today;<br/>
In every tongue and nation<br/>
She calls her sons to pray;<br/>
Across the northern snow fields,<br/>
Beneath the Indian palms,<br/>
She makes the same pure offering,<br/>
And sings the same sweet psalms.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tell out, sweet bells, His praises!<br/>
O let us sing His Name!<br/>
Still louder and still farther<br/>
His mighty deeds proclaim;<br/>
Till all whom He redeem√®d<br/>
Shall own Him Lord and King,<br/>
Till every knee shall worship,<br/>
And every tongue shall sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
