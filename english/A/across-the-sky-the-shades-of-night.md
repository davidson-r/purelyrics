<br/>
Across the sky the shades of night<br/>
This New Year’s Eve are fleeting,<br/>
We deck Thine altar, Lord, with light,<br/>
In solemn worship meeting;<br/>
And as the year’s last hours go by,<br/>
We raise to Thee our earnest cry,<br/>
Once more Thy love entreating.<br/>
<br/>
Before the cross subdued we bow,<br/>
To Thee our prayers addressing,<br/>
Recounting all Thy mercies now,<br/>
And all our sins confessing;<br/>
Beseeching Thee this coming year<br/>
To keep us in Thy faith and fear<br/>
And crown us with Thy blessing.<br/>
<br/>
And while we pray, we lift our eyes<br/>
To dear ones gone before us,<br/>
Safe home with thee in paradise,<br/>
Whose peace descendeth o’er us;<br/>
And beg of Thee, when life is past,<br/>
To reunite us all at last<br/>
With those who’ve gone before us.<br/>
<br/>
We gather up in this brief hour<br/>
The memory of Thy mercies;<br/>
Thy wondrous goodness, love and power<br/>
Our grateful song rehearses;<br/>
For Thou hast been our Strength and Stay<br/>
In many a dark and dreary day<br/>
Of sorrow and reverses.<br/>
<br/>
In many an hour when fear and dread,<br/>
Like evil spells, have bound us<br/>
And clouds were gathering overhead,<br/>
Thy providence hath found us.<br/>
In many a night when seas ran high,<br/>
Thy gracious presence, drawing nigh,<br/>
Hath made all calm around us.<br/>
<br/>
Then, O great God, in years to come,<br/>
Whatever may betide us,<br/>
Right onward through our journey home<br/>
Be Thou at hand to guide us;<br/>
Nor leave us till at close of life,<br/>
Safe from all perils, toil, and strife,<br/>
Heaven shall enfold and hide us.<br/>
