<br/>
As the bridegroom to his chosen,<br/>
As the king unto his realm,<br/>
As keep unto the castle,<br/>
As the pilot to the helm,<br/>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br/>
<br/>
As the fountain in the garden,<br/>
As the candle in the dark,<br/>
As the treasure in the coffer,<br/>
As the manna in the ark,<br/>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br/>
<br/>
As the ruby in the setting,<br/>
As the honey in the comb,<br/>
As the light within the lantern,<br/>
As the father in the home,<br/>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br/>
<br/>
As the sunshine in the heavens,<br/>
As the image in the glass,<br/>
As the fruits upon the fig tree,<br/>
As the dew upon the grass,<br/>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br/>
