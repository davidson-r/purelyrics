All my heart this night rejoices,<br/>
As I hear, far and near, sweetest angel voices;<br/>
“Christ is born,” their choirs are singing,<br/>
Till the air, everywhere, now their joy is ringing.<br/>
<br/>
Forth today the Conqueror goeth,<br/>
Who the foe, sin and woe, death and hell, o’erthroweth.<br/>
God is man, man to deliver;<br/>
His dear Son now is one with our blood forever.<br/>
<br/>
Shall we still dread God’s displeasure,<br/>
Who, to save, freely gave His most cherished Treasure?<br/>
To redeem us, He hath given<br/>
His own Son from the throne of His might in Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Should He who Himself imparted<br/>
Aught withhold from the fold, leave us broken hearted?<br/>
Should the Son of God not love us,<br/>
Who, to cheer sufferers here, left His throne above us?<br/>
<br/>
If our blessèd Lord and Maker<br/>
Hated men, would He then be of flesh partaker?<br/>
If He in our woe delighted,<br/>
Would He bear all the care of our race benighted?<br/>
<br/>
He becomes the Lamb that taketh<br/>
Sin away and for aye full atonement maketh.<br/>
For our life His own He tenders<br/>
And our race, by His grace, meet for glory renders.<br/>
<br/>
For it dawns, the promised morrow<br/>
Of His birth, Who the earth rescues from her sorrow.<br/>
God to wear our form descendeth;<br/>
Of His grace to our race here His Son He sendeth.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! a voice from yonder manger,<br/>
Soft and sweet, doth entreat, “Flee from woe and danger;<br/>
Brethren, come; from all that grieves you<br/>
You are freed; all you need I will surely give you.”<br/>
<br/>
Come, then, let us hasten yonder;<br/>
Here let all, great and small, kneel in awe and wonder,<br/>
Love Him Who with love is yearning;<br/>
Hail the star that from far bright with hope is burning.<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd Savior, let me find Thee!<br/>
Keep Thou me close to Thee, cast me not behind Thee!<br/>
Life of life, my heart Thou stillest,<br/>
Calm I rest on Thy breast, all this void Thou fillest.<br/>
<br/>
Thee, dear Lord, with heed I’ll cherish;<br/>
Live to Thee and with Thee, dying, shall not perish;<br/>
But shall dwell with Thee for ever,<br/>
Far on high, in the joy that can alter never.
