title: As shadows cast by cloud and sun

As shadows cast by cloud and sun<br/>
Flit o’er the summer grass,<br/>
So, in Thy sight, Almighty One,<br/>
Earth’s generations pass.<br/>
And as the years, an endless host,<br/>
Come swiftly pressing on,<br/>
The brightest names that earth can boast<br/>
Just glisten and are gone.<br/>
<br/>
Yet doth the star of Bethlehem shed<br/>
A luster pure and sweet;<br/>
And still it leads, as once it led,<br/>
To the Messiah’s feet.<br/>
O Father, may that holy star<br/>
Grow every year more bright,<br/>
And send its glorious beams afar<br/>
To fill the world with light.
