<br/>
At the name of Jesus<br/>
Every knee shall bow,<br/>
Every tongue confess him<br/>
King of glory now:<br/>
'Tis the Father's pleasure<br/>
We should call him Lord,<br/>
Who from the beginning<br/>
Was the mighty Word.<br/>
<br/>
At his voice creation<br/>
Sprang at once to sight,<br/>
All the angels faces<br/>
All the hosts of light,<br/>
Thrones and Dominations,<br/>
Stars upon their way,<br/>
All the heavenly orders,<br/>
In their great array.<br/>
<br/>
Humbled for a season,<br/>
To receive a name<br/>
From the lips of sinners<br/>
Unto whom he came,<br/>
Faithfully he bore it<br/>
Spotless to the last,<br/>
Brought it back victorious,<br/>
When from death he passed:<br/>
<br/>
Bore it up triumphant<br/>
With its human light,<br/>
Through all ranks of creatures,<br/>
To the central height,<br/>
To the throne of Godhead,<br/>
To the Father's breast;<br/>
Filled it with the glory<br/>
Of that perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
Name him, brothers, name him,<br/>
With love as strong as death,<br/>
But with awe and wonder<br/>
And with bated breath:<br/>
He is God the Saviour,<br/>
He is Christ the Lord,<br/>
Ever to be worshipped,<br/>
Trusted, and adored.<br/>
<br/>
In your hearts enthrone him;<br/>
There let him subdue<br/>
All that is not holy,<br/>
All that is not true:<br/>
Crown him as your captain<br/>
In temptation's hour;<br/>
Let his will enfold you<br/>
In its light and power.<br/>
<br/>
Brothers, this Lord Jesus<br/>
Shall return again,<br/>
With his Father's glory,<br/>
With his angel train;<br/>
For all wreaths of empire<br/>
Meet upon his brow,<br/>
And our hearts confess him<br/>
King of glory now.<br/>
