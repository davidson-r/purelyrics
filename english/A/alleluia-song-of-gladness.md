title: Alleluia Song Of Gladness

<center>
<br/>
Alleluia, song of gladness,<br/>
Voice of joy that cannot die;<br/>
Alleluia is the anthem<br/>
Ever dear to choirs on high;<br/>
In the house of God abiding<br/>
Thus they sing eternally.<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia thou resoundest,<br/>
True Jerusalem and free;<br/>
Alleluia, joyful mother,<br/>
All thy children sing with thee;<br/>
But by Babylon’s sad waters<br/>
Mourning exiles now are we.<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia we deserve not<br/>
Here to chant forevermore;<br/>
Alleluia our transgressions<br/>
Make us for a while give o’er;<br/>
For the holy time is coming<br/>
Bidding us our sins deplore.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore in our hymns we pray Thee,<br/>
Grant us, blessèd Trinity,<br/>
At the last to keep Thine Easter<br/>
In our home beyond the sky;<br/>
There to Thee forever singing<br/>
Alleluia joyfully.<br/>
