<center>
All praise to Thee, Eternal Lord,<br/>
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;<br/>
Choosing a manger for Thy throne,<br/>
While worlds on worlds are Thine alone.<br/>
<br/>
Once did the skies before Thee bow;<br/>
A virginâ€™s arms contain Thee now,<br/>
While angels, who in Thee rejoice,<br/>
Now listen for Thine infant voice.<br/>
<br/>
A little Child, Thou art our Guest,<br/>
That weary ones in Thee may rest;<br/>
Forlorn and lowly is Thy birth;<br/>
That we may rise to Heaven from earth.<br/>
<br/>
Thou comest in the darksome night<br/>
To make us children of the light;<br/>
To make us, in the realms divine,<br/>
Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.<br/>
<br/>
All this for us Thy love hath done;<br/>
By this to Thee our love is won;<br/>
For this we tune our cheerful lays,<br/>
And sing our thanks in ceaseless praise.
