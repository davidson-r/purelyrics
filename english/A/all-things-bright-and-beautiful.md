<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all. <br/>
<br/>
Each little flower that opens,<br/>
Each little bird that sings,<br/>
He made their glowing colours,<br/>
He made their tiny wings.<br/>
<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all<br/>
<br/>
The purple-headed mountain,<br/>
The river running by,<br/>
The sunset and the morning,<br/>
That brightens up the sky;<br/>
<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all<br/>
<br/>
The cold wind in the winter,<br/>
The pleasant summer sun,<br/>
The ripe fruits in the garden,<br/>
He made them every one;<br/>
<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all<br/>
<br/>
The tall trees in the greenwood,<br/>
The meadows for our play,<br/>
The rushes by the water,<br/>
To gather every day;<br/>
<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all<br/>
<br/>
He gave us eyes to see them,<br/>
And lips that we might tell<br/>
How great is God Almighty,<br/>
Who has made all things well.<br/>
<br/>
All things bright and beautiful,<br/>
All creatures great and small,<br/>
All things wise and wonderful,<br/>
The Lord God made them all.<br/>
