<br/>
Our fathers, in the years grown dim, reared slowly, wall by wall<br/>
A holy dwelling place for Him, that filleth all in all.<br/>
They wrought His house of faith and prayer, the rainbow round the throne,<br/>
A precious temple builded fair on Christ the Cornerstone.<br/>
<br/>
The angel of the golden reed hath found the measure strait;<br/>
He hears the Great Foundation plead for ampler wall and gate.<br/>
The living pillars of the Truth grown on from morn to morn,<br/>
And still the heresy of youth is age’s creed outworn.<br/>
<br/>
But steadfast is their inner shrine wrought of the heart’s fine gold,<br/>
Its hunger and its thirst divine, with jewels manifold,<br/>
Red sard of pain, hope’s emerald gleam, white peace, no glory missed<br/>
Of righteous life and saintly dream, jasper to amethyst.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of truth, forbid that we who now God’s temple are<br/>
And keep the faith with minds more free, our father’s fabric mar.<br/>
Better than thoughts the stars that search is self still sacrificed,<br/>
For only love can build the church whose cornerstone is Christ.<br/>
