title: Abide With Us The Day Is Waning

<br/>
“Abide with us, the day is waning,”<br/>
Thus prayed the two while on the way;<br/>
We read that Thou, O Lord, remaining,<br/>
Didst all their doubts and fears allay.<br/>
Incline Thine ear, Thou King of Grace,<br/>
When, praying thus, we seek Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
At eventide, Thy Spirit sending,<br/>
Help us, O Lord, our watch to keep,<br/>
In prayer devout before Thee bending,<br/>
Ere we our eyelids close in sleep,<br/>
Confessing sin in deed and word<br/>
With hope of mercy from the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us; with heav’nly gladness<br/>
Illumine, Lord, our darkest day;<br/>
And when we weep in pain and sadness,<br/>
Be Thou our Solace, Strength and Stay.<br/>
Tell of Thy woe, Thy victory won,<br/>
When Thou didst pray: “Thy will be done.”<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us, O Savior tender,<br/>
That bitter day when life shall end,<br/>
When to the grave we must surrender,<br/>
And fear and pain our hearts shall rend.<br/>
The shield of faith do Thou bestow<br/>
When trembling we must meet the foe.<br/>
<br/>
When earthly help no more availeth,<br/>
To sup with us Thou wilt be nigh;<br/>
Thou givest strength that never faileth,<br/>
In Thee we grave and death defy.<br/>
While earth is fading from our sight,<br/>
Our eyes behold the realms of light.<br/>
