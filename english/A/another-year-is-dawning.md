title: Another Year Is Dawning

<br/>
Another year is dawning, dear Father, let it be<br/>
In working or in waiting, another year with Thee.<br/>
Another year of progress, another year of praise,<br/>
Another year of proving Thy presence all the days.<br/>
<br/>
Another year of mercies, of faithfulness and grace,<br/>
Another year of gladness in the shining of Thy face;<br/>
Another year of leaning upon Thy loving breast;<br/>
Another year of trusting, of quiet, happy rest.<br/>
<br/>
Another year of service, of witness for Thy love,<br/>
Another year of training for holier work above.<br/>
Another year is dawning, dear Father, let it be<br/>
On earth, or else in Heaven, another year for Thee.<br/>
