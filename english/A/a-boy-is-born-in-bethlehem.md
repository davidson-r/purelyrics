A Boy is Born in Bethlehem!<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
And joy is in Jerusalem,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
And there He lay in manger poor,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
Whose rein shall last for ever-more,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
The ass and ox and all the heard,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
Knew well that Boy to be the Lord!<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
And kings from out the East there were,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
With gold and frankincense and myrrh<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
He lived like us in form and dress,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
Without our taint of wickedness.<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
He came our souls to purify,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
and bring us safe to bliss on high<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Therefore let us with one accord,<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!<br/>
On this His Birthday praise the Lord!<br/>
Allelujah! Allelujah!
