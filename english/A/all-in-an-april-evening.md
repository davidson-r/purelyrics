title: All In An April Evening

<br/>
All in the April morning, <br/>
April airs were abroad; <br/>
The sheep with their little lambs <br/>
Pass'd me by on the road. <br/>
<br/>
The sheep with their little lambs <br/>
Pass'd me by on the road; <br/>
All in an April evening <br/>
I thought on the Lamb of God. <br/>
<br/>
The lambs were weary, and crying <br/>
With a weak human cry; <br/>
I thought on the Lamb of God <br/>
Going meekly to die. <br/>
<br/>
Up in the blue, blue mountains <br/>
Dewy pastures are sweet: <br/>
Rest for the little bodies, <br/>
Rest for the little feet. <br/>
<br/>
Rest for the Lamb of God <br/>
Up on the hill-top green; <br/>
Only a cross of shame <br/>
Two stark crosses between. <br/>
<br/>
All in the April evening, <br/>
April airs were abroad; <br/>
I saw the sheep with their lambs, <br/>
And thought on the Lamb of God. <br/>
