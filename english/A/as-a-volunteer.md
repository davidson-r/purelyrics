<br/>
A call for loyal soldiers<br/>
Comes to one and all;<br/>
Soldiers for the conflict,<br/>
Will you heed the call?<br/>
Will you answer quickly,<br/>
With a ready cheer,<br/>
Will you be enlisted<br/>
As a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A volunteer for Jesus,<br/>
A soldier true!<br/>
Others have enlisted,<br/>
Why not you?<br/>
Jesus is the Captain,<br/>
We will never fear,<br/>
Will you be enlisted<br/>
As a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Jesus calls for soldiers<br/>
Who are filled with pow’r,<br/>
Soldiers who will serve Him<br/>
Ev’ry day and hour;<br/>
He will not forsake you,<br/>
He is ever near;<br/>
Will you be enlisted<br/>
As a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He calls you, for He loves you<br/>
With a heart most kind,<br/>
He whose heart was broken,<br/>
Broken for mankind;<br/>
Now, just now, He calls you,<br/>
Calls in accents clear,<br/>
Will you be enlisted<br/>
As a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And when the war is over,<br/>
And the vict’ry won,<br/>
When the true and faithful<br/>
Gather one by one,<br/>
He will crown with glory<br/>
All who there appear;<br/>
Will you be enlisted<br/>
As a volunteer?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
