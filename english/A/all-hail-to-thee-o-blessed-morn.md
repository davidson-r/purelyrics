All hail to thee, O blessèd morn!<br/>
To tidings long by prophets borne<br/>
Hast thou fulfillment given.<br/>
O sacred and immortal day,<br/>
When unto earth, in glorious ray,<br/>
Descends the grace of Heaven!<br/>
Singing, ringing, sounds are blending,<br/>
Praises sending unto Heaven<br/>
For the Savior to us given.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis God’s own Image and withal,<br/>
The Son of Man, that mortals all<br/>
May find in Him a Brother.<br/>
He comes, with peace and love to bide<br/>
On earth, the erring race to guide<br/>
And help as could no other;<br/>
Rather gather closer, fonder,<br/>
Sheep that wander, feed and fold them,<br/>
Than let evil powers hold them.<br/>
<br/>
He tears, like other men, will shed,<br/>
Our sorrows share, and be our aid,<br/>
Through His eternal power;<br/>
The Lord’s good will unto us show,<br/>
And mingle in our cup of woe<br/>
The drops of mercy’s shower;<br/>
Dying, buying through His passion<br/>
Our salvation and to mortals<br/>
Opening the heavenly portals.<br/>
<br/>
He comes, for our redemption sent,<br/>
And by His glory Heaven is rent<br/>
To close upon us never;<br/>
Our blessèd Shepherd He would be,<br/>
Whom we may follow faithfully<br/>
And be with Him forever;<br/>
Higher, nigher glory winging,<br/>
Praises singing to the Father<br/>
And His Son, our Lord and Savior.
