<br/>
Angels from the realms of glory,<br/>
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;<br/>
Ye who sang creation's story,<br/>
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Worship Christ, the newborn King!<br/>
<br/>
Shepherds, in the fields abiding,<br/>
Watching o'er your flocks by night,<br/>
God with man is now residing,<br/>
Yonder shines the infant Light;<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Worship Christ, the newborn King!<br/>
<br/>
Sages, leave your contemplations,<br/>
Brighter visions beam afar;<br/>
Seek the great desire of nations,<br/>
Ye have seen His natal star;<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Worship Christ, the newborn King!<br/>
<br/>
Saints before the altar bending,<br/>
Watching long in hope and fear,<br/>
Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br/>
In His temple shall appear:<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Worship Christ, the newborn King!<br/>
