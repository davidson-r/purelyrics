title: And Let This Feeble Body Fail

<br/>
And let this feeble body fail,<br/>
And let it droop and die;<br/>
My soul shall quit the mournful vale,<br/>
And soar to worlds on high;<br/>
Shall join the disembodied saints,<br/>
And find its long sought rest,<br/>
That only bliss for which it pants,<br/>
In my Redeemer’s breast.<br/>
<br/>
In hope of that immortal crown<br/>
I now the cross sustain,<br/>
And gladly wander up and down,<br/>
And smile at toil and pain:<br/>
I suffer out my threescore years,<br/>
Till my Deliverer come,<br/>
And wipe away His servant’s tears,<br/>
And take His exile home.<br/>
<br/>
O what hath Jesus bought for me!<br/>
Before my ravished eyes<br/>
Rivers of life divine I see,<br/>
And trees of paradise:<br/>
I see a world of spirits bright,<br/>
Who taste the pleasures there;<br/>
They all are robed in spotless white,<br/>
And conquering palms they bear.<br/>
<br/>
O what are all my sufferings here,<br/>
If, Lord, Thou count me meet<br/>
With that enraptured host to appear,<br/>
And worship at Thy feet!<br/>
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,<br/>
Take life or friends away,<br/>
But let me find them all again<br/>
In that eternal day.<br/>
