<center>
Mourner, wheresoever thou art,<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Tell the burden of thy heart,<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Tell it in thy Savior’s ear,<br/>
Cast away thine every fear,<br/>
Only speak, and He will hear;<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
<br/>
Haste thee, wand’rer, tarry not,<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Seek that consecrated spot;<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Heavy laden, sore oppressed,<br/>
Love can soothe thy troubled breast;<br/>
In the Savior find thy rest;<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
<br/>
Thoughtless sinner, come today;<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Hark! the Bride and Spirit say,<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Now a living fountain see,<br/>
Opened there for you and me,<br/>
Rich and poor, for bond and free,<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
<br/>
Blessèd thought! For every one<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Love’s atoning work is done;<br/>
At the cross there’s room!<br/>
Streams of boundless mercy flow,<br/>
Free to all who thither go;<br/>
Oh, that all the world might know<br/>
At the cross there’s room!
