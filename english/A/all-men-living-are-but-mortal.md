title: All Men Living Are But Mortal

<br/>
All men living are but mortal,<br/>
Yea, all flesh must fade as grass;<br/>
Only through death’s gloomy portal<br/>
To eternal life we pass.<br/>
This frail body here must perish<br/>
Ere the heav’nly love joys it cherish,<br/>
Ere it gain the free reward<br/>
For the ransomed of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, when my God doth choose it,<br/>
Willingly I’ll yield my life<br/>
Nor will grieve that I should lose it,<br/>
For with sorrows it was rife.<br/>
In my dear Redeemer’s merit<br/>
Peace hath found my troubled spirit,<br/>
And in death my comfort this:<br/>
Jesus’ death my source of bliss.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus for my sake descended<br/>
My salvation to obtain;<br/>
Death and hell for me are ended,<br/>
Peace and hope are now my gain;<br/>
Yea, with joy I leave earth’s sadness<br/>
For the home of heav’nly gladness,<br/>
Where I shall forever see<br/>
God, the Holy Trinity.<br/>
<br/>
There is joy beyond our telling,<br/>
Where so many saints have gone;<br/>
Thousands, thousands, there are dwelling,<br/>
Worshiping before the throne,<br/>
There the seraphim are shining,<br/>
Evermore in chorus joining:<br/>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!<br/>
Triune God, for aye adored!”<br/>
<br/>
Patriarchs of sacred story<br/>
And the prophets there are found;<br/>
The apostles, too, in glory<br/>
On twelve seats are there enthroned,<br/>
All the saints that have ascended<br/>
Age on age, through time extended,<br/>
There in blissful concert sing<br/>
Hallelujahs to their King.<br/>
<br/>
O Jerusalem, how glorious<br/>
Dost thou shine, thou city fair!<br/>
Lo, I hear the tone victorious<br/>
Ever sweetly sounding there.<br/>
Oh, the bliss that there surprises!<br/>
Lo, the sun of morn now rises,<br/>
And the breaking day I see<br/>
That shall never end for me.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, I see what here was told me,<br/>
See that wondrous glory shine,<br/>
Feel the spotless robes enfold me,<br/>
Know a golden crown is mine,<br/>
Thus before the throne so glorious<br/>
Now I stand a soul victorious,<br/>
Gazing on that joy for aye<br/>
That shall never pass away.<br/>
