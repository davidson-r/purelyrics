<br/>
And can it be that I should gain<br/>
An interest in the Savior’s blood?<br/>
Died He for me, who caused His pain—<br/>
For me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>
Amazing love! How can it be,<br/>
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?<br/>
Amazing love! How can it be,<br/>
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?<br/>
<br/>
’Tis mystery all: th’Immortal dies:<br/>
Who can explore His strange design?<br/>
In vain the firstborn seraph tries<br/>
To sound the depths of love divine.<br/>
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,<br/>
Let angel minds inquire no more.<br/>
’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;<br/>
Let angel minds inquire no more.<br/>
<br/>
He left His Father’s throne above<br/>
So free, so infinite His grace—<br/>
Emptied Himself of all but love,<br/>
And bled for Adam’s helpless race:<br/>
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>
For O my God, it found out me!<br/>
’Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>
For O my God, it found out me!<br/>
<br/>
Long my imprisoned spirit lay,<br/>
Fast bound in sin and nature’s night;<br/>
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—<br/>
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>
My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br/>
My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Still the small inward voice I hear,<br/>
That whispers all my sins forgiven;<br/>
Still the atoning blood is near,<br/>
That quenched the wrath of hostile Heaven.<br/>
I feel the life His wounds impart;<br/>
I feel the Savior in my heart.<br/>
I feel the life His wounds impart;<br/>
I feel the Savior in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
No condemnation now I dread;<br/>
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br/>
Alive in Him, my living Head,<br/>
And clothed in righteousness divine,<br/>
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,<br/>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br/>
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,<br/>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br/>
