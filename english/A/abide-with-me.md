title: Abide With Me

<br/>
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;<br/>
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.<br/>
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br/>
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;<br/>
Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;<br/>
Change and decay in all around I see;<br/>
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;<br/>
But as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord,<br/>
Familiar, condescending, patient, free.<br/>
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,<br/>
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings,<br/>
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea—<br/>
Come, Friend of sinners, and thus bide with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thou on my head in early youth didst smile;<br/>
And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,<br/>
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee,<br/>
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
I need Thy presence every passing hour.<br/>
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?<br/>
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?<br/>
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;<br/>
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.<br/>
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?<br/>
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.<br/>
<br/>
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;<br/>
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.<br/>
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;<br/>
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.<br/>
