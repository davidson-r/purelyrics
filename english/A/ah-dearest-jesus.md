<br/>
Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,<br/>
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled<br/>
Within my heart, that it may be<br/>
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
My heart for very joy doth leap,<br/>
My lips no more can silence keep;<br/>
I, too, must sing with joyful tongue<br/>
That sweetest ancient cradle song.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God in highest Heaven,<br/>
Who unto man His Son hath given;<br/>
While angels sing with tender mirth,<br/>
A glad new year to all the earth.<br/>
