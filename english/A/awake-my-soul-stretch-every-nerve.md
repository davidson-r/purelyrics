title: Awake My Soul Stretch Every Nerve

<center>
Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,<br/>
And press with vigor on;<br/>
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,<br/>
And an immortal crown,<br/>
And an immortal crown.<br/>
<br/>
A cloud of witnesses around<br/>
Hold thee in full survey;<br/>
Forget the steps already trod,<br/>
And onward urge thy way,<br/>
And onward urge thy way.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis God’s all animating voice<br/>
That calls thee from on high;<br/>
’Tis His own hand presents the prize<br/>
To thine aspiring eye.<br/>
<br/>
Then wake, my soul, stretch every nerve,<br/>
And press with vigor on,<br/>
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,<br/>
And an immortal crown.
