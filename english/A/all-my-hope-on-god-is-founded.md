title: All My Hope On God Is Founded

<br/>
All my hope on God is founded;<br/>
He doth still my trust renew,<br/>
Me through change and chance He guideth,<br/>
Only good and only true.<br/>
God unknown, He alone<br/>
Calls my heart to be His own.<br/>
<br/>
Pride of man and earthly glory,<br/>
Sword and crown betray His trust;<br/>
What with care and toil He buildeth,<br/>
Tower and temple fall to dust.<br/>
But God’s power, hour by hour,<br/>
Is my temple and my tower.<br/>
<br/>
God’s great goodness aye endureth,<br/>
Deep His wisdom, passing thought:<br/>
Splendor, light and life attend him,<br/>
Beauty springeth out of naught.<br/>
Evermore from His store<br/>
Newborn worlds rise and adore.<br/>
<br/>
Daily doth th’almighty Giver<br/>
Bounteous gifts on us bestow;<br/>
His desire our soul delighteth,<br/>
Pleasure leads us where we go.<br/>
Love doth stand at His hand;<br/>
Joy doth wait on His command.<br/>
<br/>
Still from man to God eternal<br/>
Sacrifice of praise be done,<br/>
High above all praises praising<br/>
For the gift of Christ, His Son.<br/>
Christ doth call one and all:<br/>
Ye who follow shall not fall.<br/>
