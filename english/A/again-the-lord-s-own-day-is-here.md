Again the Lord’s own day is here,<br/>
The day to Christian people dear,<br/>
As, week by week, it bids them tell<br/>
How Jesus rose from death and hell.<br/>
<br/>
For by His flock their Lord declared<br/>
His resurrection should be shared;<br/>
And we who trust in Him to save<br/>
With Him are risen from the grave.<br/>
<br/>
We, one and all, of Him possessed,<br/>
Are with exceeding treasures blessed,<br/>
For all He did, and all He bare,<br/>
He gives us as our own to share.<br/>
<br/>
Eternal glory, rest on high,<br/>
A blessèd immortality,<br/>
True peace and gladness, and a throne,<br/>
Are all His gifts, and all our own.<br/>
<br/>
And therefore unto Thee we sing,<br/>
O Lord of peace, eternal King;<br/>
Thy love we praise, Thy Name adore,<br/>
Both on this day and evermore.
