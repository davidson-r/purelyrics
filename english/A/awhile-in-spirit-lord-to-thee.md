title: Awhile In Spirit Lord To Thee

<br/>
Awhile in spirit, Lord, to Thee<br/>
Into the desert we would flee;<br/>
Awhile upon the barren steep<br/>
Our fast with Thee in spirit keep.<br/>
<br/>
Awhile from Thy temptation learn<br/>
The daily snares of sin to spurn,<br/>
And in our hearts to feel and own<br/>
Man liveth not by bread alone.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou once tempted like as we,<br/>
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br/>
Be Thou our Helper in the strife,<br/>
Be Thou our true, our inward Life.<br/>
<br/>
And while, at Thy command we pray,<br/>
“Give us our bread from day to day,”<br/>
May we with Thee, O Christ, be fed,<br/>
Thou Word of God, Thou living Bread.<br/>
