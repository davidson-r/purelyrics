<center>
Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue,<br/>
My glory wake and sing,<br/>
And celebrate the holy birth,<br/>
The birth of Israel’s King!<br/>
<br/>
O happy night that brought forth light,<br/>
Which makes the blind to see,<br/>
The Dayspring from on high came down<br/>
To cheer and visit thee.<br/>
<br/>
The careful shepherds with their flocks<br/>
Were watching for the morn,<br/>
But better news from Heav’n was brought;<br/>
Your Savior now is born!<br/>
<br/>
In Bethlehem the Infant lies,<br/>
Within a place obscure,<br/>
Your Savior’s come, O sing God’s praise!<br/>
O sing His praise fore’er.
</center>
