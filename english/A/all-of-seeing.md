<br/>
All of seeing, all of hearing,<br/>
Ev'ry fragrance we perceive,<br/>
All our touch and all our tasting,<br/>
In thy Heart we consecrate.<br/>
In its cooling fire, Mary,<br/>
All our senses immolate. <br/>
<br/>
All of heart can know of sadness,<br/>
Ev'ry thing it knows of joy,<br/>
Ev'ry thing it feels as fearsome,<br/>
In thy Heart we consecrate.<br/>
In its noble fire, Mary,<br/>
All our passions elevate. <br/>
<br/>
All the soul can claim of wisdom,<br/>
All it stores in memory,<br/>
All the science that we master,<br/>
In thy Heart we consecrate.<br/>
In its humble fire, Mary,<br/>
All our knowledge dedicate. <br/>
<br/>
All our hearts perceive as lofty,<br/>
All that moves our will to love,<br/>
Ev'ry gift that makes us Christ-like,<br/>
In thy Heart we consecrate.<br/>
In its living fire, Mary,<br/>
All our being consummate. <br/>
