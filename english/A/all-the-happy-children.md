<br/>
All the happy children, gladly join our song,<br/>
Rising to the Father, in a chorus strong.<br/>
Birds are brightly singing, leaves are opening wide,<br/>
Flower bells are ringing forth on every side.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All the happy children, gladly join our song,<br/>
Rising to the Father, in a chorus strong.<br/>
<br/>
See the sky above us, spread so warm and blue,<br/>
So Godâ€™s love is reaching over me and you.<br/>
Father, dear we thank Thee for long summer days,<br/>
For the birds and flowers, for the grassy ways.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
All the happy children thank Thee, Father dear,<br/>
For this day for children out of all the year.<br/>
We will still remember we are Thine alone;<br/>
He Who made the summer made us every one.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
