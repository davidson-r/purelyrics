title: At Thy Feet O Christ

<br/>
At Thy feet, O Christ, we lay<br/>
Thine own gift of this new day;<br/>
Doubt of what it holds in store<br/>
Makes us crave Thine aid the more;<br/>
Lest it prove a time of loss,<br/>
Mark, it Savior, with Thy Cross.<br/>
<br/>
If it flow on calm and bright,<br/>
Be Thyself our chief Delight;<br/>
If it bring unknown distress,<br/>
Good is all that Thou canst bless;<br/>
Only, while its hours begin,<br/>
Pray we, keep them clear of sin.<br/>
<br/>
We in part our weakness know<br/>
And in part discern our foe;<br/>
Well for us, before Thine eyes<br/>
All our danger open lies;<br/>
Turn not from us, while we plead<br/>
Thy compassions and our need.<br/>
<br/>
Fain would we Thy Word embrace,<br/>
Live each moment on Thy grace,<br/>
All our selves to Thee consign,<br/>
Fold up all our wills in Thine,<br/>
Think, and speak, and do, and be<br/>
Simply that which pleases Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Hear us, Lord, and that right soon;<br/>
Hear, and grant the choicest boon<br/>
That Thy love can eâ€™er impart,<br/>
Loyal singleness of heart;<br/>
So shall this and all our days,<br/>
Christ and God, show forth Thy praise.<br/>
