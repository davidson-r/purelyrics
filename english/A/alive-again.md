<br/>
Mary beheld Him, and “Master!” cried,<br/>
After He came from the tomb;<br/>
Suddenly Jesus stood in their midst,<br/>
Entered the tight shut room.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He Who was dead is alive again!<br/>
He Who was dead is alive again!<br/>
Broken the stout, icy clutches of death—<br/>
He Who was dead is alive again!<br/>
<br/>
Peter beheld Him there on the shore,<br/>
Ate with Him there by the sea;<br/>
Jesus was saying, with lips once dead,<br/>
“Peter, dost thou love Me?”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thomas beheld Him there in the room,<br/>
Called Him his Master and Lord,<br/>
Put forth his fingers into the holes<br/>
Made by the nails and sword.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
