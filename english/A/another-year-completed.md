<br/>
Another year completed,<br/>
The day comes round once more<br/>
Which with our patron’s radiance<br/>
Is bright as heretofore.<br/>
Now, strong in hope, united<br/>
His festival we greet;<br/>
He will present our troubles<br/>
Before the mercy-seat.<br/>
<br/>
The Scriptures tell how Moses<br/>
Did for the people pray,<br/>
Appeased the Judge eternal,<br/>
And turned His wrath away;<br/>
Elijah’s prayer had power,<br/>
To close and open Heav’n;<br/>
Such saints as were aforetime,<br/>
Such saints to us are giv’n.<br/>
<br/>
O saint of God, belovèd,<br/>
And placed on His right hand,<br/>
Thy prayers be like a rampart<br/>
As ’gainst the foe we stand;<br/>
For Abraham’s God is thy God,<br/>
And Isaac’s God is thine,<br/>
Thine is the God of Jacob,<br/>
The Lord of power benign.<br/>
<br/>
For forty years His Israel<br/>
He fed with angels’ food;<br/>
The flinty rock He opened<br/>
The streams of water flowed.<br/>
Entreat that Christ His people<br/>
May lead to victory:<br/>
The God of Joshua’s triumph<br/>
The Lord thy God is He.<br/>
