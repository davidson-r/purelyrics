<br/>
The shepherds had an angel,<br/>
The wise men had a star;<br/>
But what have I, a little child,<br/>
To guide me home from far,<br/>
Where glad stars sing together,<br/>
And singing angels are?<br/>
<br/>
The Wise Men left their country<br/>
To journey morn by morn,<br/>
With gold and frankincense and myrrh,<br/>
Because the Lord was born:<br/>
God sent a star to guide them,<br/>
And sent a dream to warn.<br/>
<br/>
My life is like their journey,<br/>
Their star is like God's book.<br/>
I must be like these good Wise Men,<br/>
With heav'n-ward heart and look:<br/>
But shall I give no gifts to God?<br/>
What precious gifts they took<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I will give my love to Thee,<br/>
Than gold much costlier.<br/>
Sweeter to Thee than frankincense,<br/>
More prized than the choicest myrrh,<br/>
Lord, make me dearer day by day,<br/>
Day by day holier; (Day by day holier.).<br/>
<br/>
Nearer and dearer day by day,<br/>
Till I my voice unite<br/>
And sing "Glory, glory"<br/>
With angels clad in white;<br/>
All "Glory, glory" given to Thee,<br/>
All "Glory, glory" given to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Through all the heav'nly height.<br/>
All "Glory, glory."<br/>
Through all the heav'nly height.<br/>
All "Glory, glory." given to Thee.<br/>
