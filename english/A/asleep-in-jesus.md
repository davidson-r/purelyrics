<center>
Asleep in Jesus! Blessèd sleep,<br/>
From which none ever wakes to weep;<br/>
A calm and undisturbed repose,<br/>
Unbroken by the last of foes.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet,<br/>
To be for such a slumber meet,<br/>
With holy confidence to sing<br/>
That death has lost his venomed sting!<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,<br/>
Whose waking is supremely blessed;<br/>
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour<br/>
That manifests the Savior’s power.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Oh, for me<br/>
May such a blessèd refuge be!<br/>
Securely shall my ashes lie<br/>
And wait the summons from on high.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! time nor space<br/>
Debars this precious “hiding place”;<br/>
On Indian plains or Lapland snows<br/>
Believers find the same respose.<br/>
<br/>
Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee<br/>
Thy kindred and their graves may be;<br/>
But there is still a blessèd sleep,<br/>
From which none ever wakes to weep.
