title: And Can It Be That I Should Gain

<br/>
And can it be, that I should gain<br/>
An interest in the Saviour's blood?<br/>
Died He for me, who caused His pain<br/>
For me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>
Amazing love! how can it be<br/>
That Thou, my God, shoulds't die for me?<br/>
<br/>
'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies:<br/>
Who can explore His strange design?<br/>
In vain the first-born seraph tries<br/>
To sound the depths of love divine.<br/>
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,<br/>
Let angel minds inquire no more.<br/>
<br/>
He left His Father's throne above,<br/>
So free, so infinite His grace,<br/>
Emptied Himself of all but love,<br/>
And bled for Adam's helpless race:<br/>
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;<br/>
For, O my God, it found out me!<br/>
<br/>
Long my imprisoned spirit lay<br/>
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br/>
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,<br/>
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>
My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
I rose, went forth and followed Thee.<br/>
<br/>
No condemnation now I dread;<br/>
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!<br/>
Alive in Him, my living Head,<br/>
And clothed in righteousness divine,<br/>
Bold I approach the eternal throne,<br/>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br/>
