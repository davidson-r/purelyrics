<center>
God of our fathers, whose almighty hand<br/>
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band<br/>
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies<br/>
Our grateful songs before Thy throne arise. <br/>
<br/>
Thy love divine hath led us in the past,<br/>
In this free land by Thee our lot is cast,<br/>
Be Thou our Ruler, Guardian, Guide and Stay,<br/>
Thy Word our law, Thy paths our chosen way. <br/>
<br/>
From warâ€™s alarms, from deadly pestilence,<br/>
Be Thy strong arm our ever sure defense;<br/>
Thy true religion in our hearts increase,<br/>
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace. <br/>
<br/>
Refresh Thy people on their toilsome way,<br/>
Lead us from night to never ending day;<br/>
Fill all our lives with love and grace divine,<br/>
And glory, laud, and praise be ever Thine.
