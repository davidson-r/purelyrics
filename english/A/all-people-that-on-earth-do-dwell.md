<br/>
All people that on earth do dwell,<br/>
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;<br/>
Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,<br/>
Come ye before him, and rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed,<br/>
Without our aid he did us make;<br/>
We are his folk, he doth us feed,<br/>
And for his sheep he doth us take.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
O enter then his gates with praise,<br/>
Approach with joy his courts unto;<br/>
Praise, laud, and bless his name always,<br/>
For it is seemly so to do.<br/>
<br/>
For why? The Lord our God is good:<br/>
His mercy is for ever sure;<br/>
His truth at all times firmly stood,<br/>
And shall from age to age endure.<br/>
<br/>
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br/>
The God whom heaven and earth adore,<br/>
From men and from the Angel-host<br/>
Be praise and glory evermore. Amen. <br/>
