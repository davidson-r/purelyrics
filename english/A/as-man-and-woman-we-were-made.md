<br/>
As man and woman we were made<br/>
That love be found and life begun,<br/>
So praise the Lord Who made us two,<br/>
And praise the Lord when two are one;<br/>
Praise for the love that comes to life<br/>
Through child or parent, husband, wife.<br/>
<br/>
Now Jesus lived and gave His love<br/>
To make our life and loving new;<br/>
So celebrate with Him today<br/>
And drink the joy He offers you;<br/>
That makes the simple moment shine<br/>
And changes water into wine.<br/>
<br/>
And Jesus died to live again,<br/>
So praise the love that, come what may,<br/>
Can bring the dawn and clear the skies,<br/>
And waits to wipe all tears away;<br/>
And let us hope for what shall be,<br/>
Believing where we cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
Then spread the table, clear the hall,<br/>
And celebrate till day is done;<br/>
Let peace go deep between us all<br/>
And joy be shared by everyone;<br/>
Laugh and make merry with your friends,<br/>
And praise the love that never ends!<br/>
