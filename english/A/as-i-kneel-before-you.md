<br/>
As I kneel before you,<br/>
As I bow my head in prayer,<br/>
Take this day, make it yours<br/>
and fill me with your love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
Ave Maria,<br/>
Gratia plena,<br/>
Dominus tecum,<br/>
Benedicta tu.<br/>
<br/>
All I have I give you,<br/>
Every dream and wish are yours,<br/>
Mother of Christ,<br/>
Mother of mine, present them to my Lord.<br/>
<br/>
(Repeat Refrain)<br/>
<br/>
As I kneel before you,<br/>
And I see your smiling face,<br/>
Ev'ry thought, ev'ry word<br/>
Is lost in your embrace.<br/>
<br/>
(Repeat Refrain) <br/>
