<br/>
As with gladness, men of old<br/>
Did the guiding star behold<br/>
As with joy they hailed its light<br/>
Leading onward, beaming bright<br/>
So, most glorious Lord, may we<br/>
Evermore be led to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
As with joyful steps they sped<br/>
To that lowly manger bed<br/>
There to bend the knee before<br/>
Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;<br/>
So may we with willing feet<br/>
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.<br/>
<br/>
As they offered gifts most rare<br/>
At that manger rude and bare;<br/>
So may we with holy joy,<br/>
Pure and free from sinâ€™s alloy,<br/>
All our costliest treasures bring,<br/>
Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Jesus, every day<br/>
Keep us in the narrow way;<br/>
And, when earthly things are past,<br/>
Bring our ransomed souls at last<br/>
Where they need no star to guide,<br/>
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.<br/>
<br/>
In the heavenly country bright,<br/>
Need they no created light;<br/>
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,<br/>
Thou its Sun which goes not down;<br/>
There forever may we sing<br/>
Alleluias to our King!<br/>
