title: As Each Happy Christmas

<center>
As each happy Christmas<br/>
Dawns on earth again,<br/>
Comes the holy Christ Child<br/>
To the hearts of men.<br/>
<br/>
Enters with His blessing<br/>
Into every home,<br/>
Guides and guards our footsteps,<br/>
As we go and come.<br/>
<br/>
All unknown, beside me,<br/>
He will ever stand,<br/>
And will safely lead me<br/>
With His own right hand.
