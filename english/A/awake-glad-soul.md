<center>
Awake, glad soul! Awake! Awake!<br/>
Thy Lord has risen long;<br/>
Go to His grave, and with thee take<br/>
Both tuneful heart and song.<br/>
<br/>
Where life is waking all around,<br/>
Where loveâ€™s sweet voices sing,<br/>
The first bright blossom may be found<br/>
Of an eternal spring.<br/>
<br/>
The shade and gloom of life are fled<br/>
This resurrection day;<br/>
Henceforth in Christ are no more dead,<br/>
The grave hath no more prey.<br/>
<br/>
In Christ we live, in Christ we sleep,<br/>
In Christ we wake and rise,<br/>
And the sad tears death makes us weep,<br/>
He wipes from all our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
And every bird and every tree,<br/>
And every opening flower,<br/>
Proclaim His glorious victory,<br/>
His resurrection power.<br/>
<br/>
The folds are glad, the fields rejoice,<br/>
With vernal verdure spread,<br/>
The little hills lift up their voice<br/>
And shout that death is dead.<br/>
<br/>
Then wake, glad heart! awake! awake<br/>
And seek Thy risen Lord;<br/>
Joy in His resurrection take,<br/>
And comfort in His Word.<br/>
<br/>
And let thy life, through all its ways,<br/>
One long thanksgiving be:<br/>
Its theme of joy, its song of praise<br/>
Christ died, and rose for me.
