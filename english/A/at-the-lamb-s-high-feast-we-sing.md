<br/>
At the Lamb’s high feast we sing,<br/>
Praise to our victorious King,<br/>
Who hath washed us in the tide<br/>
Flowing from his piercèd side;<br/>
Praise we Him, Whose love divine<br/>
Gives His sacred blood for wine,<br/>
Gives His body for the feast,<br/>
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.<br/>
<br/>
Where the Paschal blood is poured,<br/>
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;<br/>
Israel’s hosts triumphant go<br/>
Through the wave that drowns the foe.<br/>
Praise we Christ, Whose blood was shed,<br/>
Paschal Victim, paschal Bread;<br/>
With sincerity and love<br/>
Eat we Manna from above.<br/>
<br/>
Mighty Victim from the sky,<br/>
Hell’s fierce powers beneath Thee lie;<br/>
Thou hast conquered in the fight,<br/>
Thou hast brought us life and light;<br/>
Now no more can death appall,<br/>
Now no more the grave enthrall;<br/>
Thou hast opened Paradise,<br/>
And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.<br/>
<br/>
Paschal triumph, Easter joy,<br/>
Only sin can this destroy;<br/>
From sin’s death do Thou set free<br/>
Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.<br/>
Hymns of glory and of praise,<br/>
Father, to Thee we raise;<br/>
Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,<br/>
Ever with the Spirit be.<br/>
