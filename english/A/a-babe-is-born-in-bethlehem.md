A Babe is born in Bethlehem, Bethlehem,<br/>
Therefore rejoice Jerusalem,<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Within a manger He doth lie, He doth lie,<br/>
Whose throne is set above the sky.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Stillness was all the manger round, manger round,<br/>
The creature its Creator found.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
The wise men came, led by the star, by the star,<br/>
Gold, myrrh, and incense brought from far.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
His mother is the virgin mild, virgin mild,<br/>
And He the Father’s only Child.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
The serpent’s wound He beareth not, beareth not,<br/>
Yet takes our blood, and shares our lot,<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
Our human flesh He enters in, enters in,<br/>
But bears no single taint of sin.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
To fallen man Himself He bowed, self He bowed,<br/>
That He might lift us up to God.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
On this most blessèd Jubilee, Jubilee,<br/>
All glory be, O God, to Thee.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Three, we Thee adore, Thee adore,<br/>
This day, henceforth, forevermore.<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
