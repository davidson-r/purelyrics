title: Angels Roll The Rock Away

<center>
Angels, roll the rock away,<br/>
Death, yield up your mighty Prey.<br/>
See, the Savior leaves the tomb,<br/>
Glowing with immortal bloom,<br/>
Glowing with immortal bloom.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis the Savior! angels, raise<br/>
Fame’s eternal trump of praise.<br/>
Let the world’s remotest bound<br/>
Hear the joy inspiring sound,<br/>
Hear the joy inspiring sound.<br/>
<br/>
Now ye saints, lift up your eyes<br/>
Now to glory see Him rise,<br/>
In long triumph up the sky,<br/>
Up to waiting worlds on high,<br/>
Up to waiting worlds on high.
