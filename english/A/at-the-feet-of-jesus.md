title: At The Feet Of Jesus

<center>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>
Listening to His word;<br/>
Learning wisdom’s lesson<br/>
From her loving Lord;<br/>
Mary, led by heav’nly grace,<br/>
Chose the meek disciple’s place.<br/>
At the feet of Jesus<br/>
Is the place for me,<br/>
There a humble learner<br/>
Would I choose to be.<br/>
<br/>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>
Pouring perfume rare,<br/>
Mary did her Savior<br/>
For the grave prepare;<br/>
And, from love the “good work” done,<br/>
She her Lord’s approval won.<br/>
At the feet of Jesus<br/>
Is the place for me,<br/>
There, in sweetest service<br/>
Would I ever be.<br/>
<br/>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>
In that morning hour,<br/>
Loving hearts, receiving<br/>
Resurrection power,<br/>
Haste with joy to preach the word;<br/>
“Christ is risen, praise the Lord!”<br/>
At the feet of Jesus,<br/>
Risen now for me,<br/>
I shall sing His praises<br/>
Through eternity.
