<center>
Lord, guard and guide the men who fly<br/>
Through the great spaces of the sky;<br/>
Be with them traversing the air <br/>
In darkening storms or sunshine fair<br/>
<br/>
Thou who dost keep with tender might<br/>
The balanced birds in all their flight<br/>
Thou of the tempered winds be near<br/>
That, having thee, they know no fear<br/>
<br/>
Control their minds with instinct fit<br/>
What time, adventuring, they quit<br/>
The firm security of land;<br/>
Grant steadfast eye and skilful hand<br/>
<br/>
Aloft in solitudes of space,<br/>
Uphold them with Thy saving grace.<br/>
O God, protect the men who fly<br/>
Thru lonely ways beneath the sky.
</center>
