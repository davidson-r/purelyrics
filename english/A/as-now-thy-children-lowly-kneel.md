title: As Now Thy Children Lowly Kneel

<br/>
As now Thy children lowly kneel,<br/>
And all for mercy pray,<br/>
O Father, make us truly feel<br/>
The solemn words we say.<br/>
<br/>
Teach us to hate the power of sin,<br/>
Which parts our souls from Thee;<br/>
Help us to make our life within<br/>
What Thou wilt love to see.<br/>
<br/>
Teach us to trust the Lamb of God,<br/>
Who takes our sins away;<br/>
Help us to choose the path He trod,<br/>
And so Thy will obey.<br/>
<br/>
Teach us to keep Thy holy laws<br/>
Because we trust Thy love;<br/>
Help us to rise, when Jesus draws<br/>
To better joys above.<br/>
<br/>
O teach us more our sins to fear<br/>
And more Thy Word to love:<br/>
Help us on earth the cross to bear<br/>
And win the crown above.<br/>
