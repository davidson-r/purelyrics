<br/>
As the sun doth daily rise,<br/>
Brightening all the morning skies,<br/>
So to Thee with one accord<br/>
Lift we up our hearts, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Day by day provide us food,<br/>
For from Thee come all things good;<br/>
Strength unto our souls afford<br/>
From Thy living bread, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Be our guard in sin and strife;<br/>
Be the leader of our life;<br/>
Lest from Thee we stray abroad,<br/>
Stay our wayward feet, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Quickened by the Spiritâ€™s grace<br/>
All Thy holy will to trace<br/>
While we daily search Thy Word,<br/>
Wisdom true impart, O Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Praise we, with the heavenly host,<br/>
Father, Son and Holy Ghost;<br/>
Thee would we with one accord<br/>
Praise and magnify, O Lord.<br/>
