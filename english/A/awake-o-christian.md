<br/>
Awake, O Christian, from thy sleep,<br/>
And heed thy brother’s call!<br/>
He cries to thee across the deep,<br/>
Where darkest shadows falls.<br/>
From sin and guilt and wretchedness<br/>
He knows not where to flee;<br/>
Go tell him how the Lord can bless!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>
<br/>
’Mid deepest gloom and darkest night<br/>
He lifts his helpless hands;<br/>
Can aught but Jesus give him light<br/>
Or break his cruel bands?<br/>
Then send, O send the Master’s Word<br/>
Across the wide blue sea,<br/>
Where Macedonia’s cry is heard!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>
<br/>
O save the lost, the sinner turn!<br/>
To blind men send the light!<br/>
O let thy soul with ardor burn<br/>
To lead them to the right;<br/>
Then usher in that glorious day,<br/>
The kingdom yet to be,<br/>
When all shall own the Master’s sway!<br/>
Thy brother calls to thee.<br/>
