<br/>
Advent tells us, Christ is near:<br/>
Christmas tells us Christ is here!<br/>
In Epiphany we trace<br/>
All the glory of His grace.<br/>
<br/>
Those three Sundays before Lent<br/>
Will prepare us to repent;<br/>
That in Lent we may begin<br/>
Earnestly to mourn for sin.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Week and Easter, then,<br/>
Tell who died and rose again;<br/>
O that happy Easter day!<br/>
“Christ is risen indeed,” we say.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and Christ ascended, too,<br/>
To prepare a place for you;<br/>
So we give Him special praise,<br/>
After those great forty days.<br/>
<br/>
Then, He sent the Holy Ghost,<br/>
On the day of Pentecost,<br/>
With us ever to abide:<br/>
Well may we keep Whitsuntide!<br/>
<br/>
Last of all, we humbly sing<br/>
Glory to our God and King,<br/>
Glory to the One in three,<br/>
On the Feast of Trinity.<br/>
