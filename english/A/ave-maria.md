Ave Maria! Ave Maria! maiden mild!<br/>
Listen to a maiden's prayer!<br/>
Thou canst hear though from the wild,<br/>
Thou canst save amid despair.<br/>
Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,<br/>
Though banish'd, outcast and reviled -<br/>
Maiden! hear a maiden's prayer;<br/>
Mother, hear a suppliant child!<br/>
Ave Maria! <br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! undefiled!<br/>
The flinty couch we now must share<br/>
Shall seem this down of eider piled,<br/>
If thy protection hover there.<br/>
The murky cavern's heavy air<br/>
Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;<br/>
Then, Maiden! hear a maiden's prayer;<br/>
Mother, list a suppliant child!<br/>
Ave Maria! <br/>
<br/>
Ave Maria! stainless styled!<br/>
Foul demons of the earth and air,<br/>
From this their wonted haunt exiled,<br/>
Shall flee before thy presence fair.<br/>
We bow us to our lot of care,<br/>
Beneath thy guidance reconciled;<br/>
Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer,<br/>
And for a father hear a child!<br/>
Ave Maria!
