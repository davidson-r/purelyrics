<br/>
Away with our sorrow and fear!<br/>
We soon shall recover our home,<br/>
The city of saints shall appear,<br/>
The day of eternity come:<br/>
From earth we shall quickly remove,<br/>
And mount to our native abode,<br/>
The house of our Father above,<br/>
The palace of angels and God.<br/>
<br/>
Our mourning is all at an end,<br/>
When, raised by the life-giving Word,<br/>
We see the new city descend,<br/>
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;<br/>
The city so holy and clean,<br/>
No sorrow can breathe in the air;<br/>
No gloom of affliction or sin,<br/>
No shadow of evil is there.<br/>
<br/>
By faith we already behold<br/>
That lovely Jerusalem here;<br/>
Her walls are of jasper and gold,<br/>
As crystal her buildings are clear;<br/>
Immovably founded in grace,<br/>
She stands as she ever hath stood,<br/>
And brightly her Builder displays,<br/>
And flames with the glory of God.<br/>
<br/>
No need of the sun in that day,<br/>
Which never is followed by night,<br/>
Where Jesus’ beauties display<br/>
A pure and a permanent light:<br/>
The Lamb is their light and their sun,<br/>
And lo! by reflection they shine,<br/>
With Jesus ineffably one,<br/>
And bright in effulgence divine!<br/>
<br/>
The saints in His presence receive<br/>
Their great and eternal reward;<br/>
In Jesus, in Heaven they live,<br/>
They reign in the smile of their Lord:<br/>
The flame of angelical love<br/>
Is kindled at Jesus’ face;<br/>
And all the enjoyment above<br/>
Consists in the rapturous gaze.<br/>
