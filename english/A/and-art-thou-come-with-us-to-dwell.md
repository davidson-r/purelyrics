<center>
And art Thou come with us to dwell,<br/>
Our Prince, our Guide, our Love, our Lord?<br/>
And is Thy Name Emmanuel,<br/>
God present with His world restored?<br/>
<br/>
The heart is glad for Thee! It knows<br/>
None now shall bid it err or mourn;<br/>
And o’er its desert breaks the rose<br/>
In triumph o’er the grieving thorn.<br/>
<br/>
Thou bringest all again; with Thee<br/>
Is light, is space, is breadth and room<br/>
For each thing fair, beloved, and free<br/>
To have its hour of life and bloom.<br/>
<br/>
The world is glad for Thee! the heart<br/>
Is glad for Thee! and all is well,<br/>
And fixed and sure, because Thou art,<br/>
Whose Name is called Emmanuel.
