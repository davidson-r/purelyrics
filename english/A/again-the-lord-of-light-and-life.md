<br/>
Again the Lord of light and life<br/>
Awakes the kindling ray,<br/>
Unseals the eyelids of the morn,<br/>
And pours increasing day.<br/>
<br/>
O what a night was that which wrapped<br/>
The heathen world in gloom!<br/>
O what a Sun which rose this day<br/>
Triumphant from the tomb!<br/>
<br/>
This day be grateful homage paid,<br/>
And loud hosannas sung;<br/>
Let gladness dwell in every heart,<br/>
And praise on every tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Ten thousand different lips shall join<br/>
To hail this welcome morn,<br/>
Which scatters blessings from its wings<br/>
To nations yet unborn.<br/>
