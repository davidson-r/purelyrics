title: Awake My Heart With Gladness

<center>
Awake, my heart, with gladness,<br/>
See what today is done;<br/>
Now, after gloom and sadness,<br/>
Comes forth the glorious Sun.<br/>
My Savior there was laid<br/>
Where our bed must be made<br/>
When to the realms of light<br/>
Our spirit wings its flight.<br/>
<br/>
The foe in triumph shouted<br/>
When Christ lay in the tomb;<br/>
But, lo, he now is routed,<br/>
His boast is turned to gloom.<br/>
For Christ again is free;<br/>
In glorious victory<br/>
He Who is strong to save<br/>
Has triumphed o’er the grave.<br/>
<br/>
This is a sight that gladdens;<br/>
What peace it doth impart!<br/>
Now nothing ever saddens<br/>
The joy within my heart.<br/>
No gloom shall ever shake,<br/>
No foe shall ever take,<br/>
The hope which God’s own Son<br/>
In love for me hath won.<br/>
<br/>
Now hell, its prince, the devil<br/>
Of all their powers are shorn;<br/>
Now I am safe from evil,<br/>
And sin I laugh to scorn.<br/>
Grim Death with all his might<br/>
Cannot my soul affright;<br/>
He is a powerless form,<br/>
Howe’er he rave and storm.<br/>
<br/>
The world against me rageth<br/>
Its fury I disdain;<br/>
Though bitter war it wageth<br/>
Its work is all in vain.<br/>
My heart from care is free,<br/>
No trouble troubles me.<br/>
Misfortune now is play<br/>
And night is bright as day.<br/>
<br/>
Now I will cling forever<br/>
To Christ, my Savior true;<br/>
My Lord will leave me never,<br/>
Whate’er He passeth through.<br/>
He rends Death’s iron chain,<br/>
He breaks through sin and pain,<br/>
He shatters hell’s dark thrall,<br/>
I follow Him through all.<br/>
<br/>
To halls of heavenly splendor<br/>
With Him I penetrate;<br/>
And trouble ne’er may hinder<br/>
Nor make me hesitate.<br/>
Let tempests rage at will,<br/>
My Savior shields me still;<br/>
He grants abiding peace<br/>
And bids all tumult cease.<br/>
<br/>
He brings me to the portal<br/>
That leads to bliss untold,<br/>
Whereon this rhyme immortal<br/>
Is found in script of gold:<br/>
“Who there My cross hath shared<br/>
Finds here a crown prepared;<br/>
Who there with Me hath died<br/>
Shall here be glorified.”
