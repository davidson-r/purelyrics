<br/>
All creatures of our God and King,<br/>
Lift up your voice and with us sing<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
Thou burning sun with golden beam,<br/>
Thou silver moon with softer gleam:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya! <br/>
<br/>
Thou rushing wind that art so strong,<br/>
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along,<br/>
O praise him, Alleluya!<br/>
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,<br/>
Ye lights of evening, find a voice:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
<br/>
Thou flowing water, pure and clear,<br/>
Make music for thy Lord to hear,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
Thou fire so masterful and bright,<br/>
That givest man both warmth and light:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
<br/>
Dear mother earth, who day by day<br/>
Unfoldest blessings on our way,<br/>
Praise him, Alleluya!<br/>
The flowers and fruits that in thee grow,<br/>
Let them his glory also show:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
<br/>
And all ye men of tender heart,<br/>
Forgiving others, take your part,<br/>
O sing ye, Alleluya!<br/>
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,<br/>
Praise God and on him cast your care:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
<br/>
And thou, most kind and gentle death,<br/>
Waiting to hush our latest breath,<br/>
O praise him, Alleluya!<br/>
Thou leadest home the child of God,<br/>
And Christ our Lord the way hath trod:<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
<br/>
Let all things their Creator bless,<br/>
And worship him in humbleness,<br/>
O praise him, Alleluya!<br/>
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,<br/>
And praise the Spirit, three in One.<br/>
O praise him, O praise him,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya!<br/>
