<br/>
Arise, sons of the kingdom!<br/>
The King is drawing nigh;<br/>
Arise, and hail with gladness<br/>
The Ruler from on high.<br/>
Ye Christians, hasten forth!<br/>
Your praise and homage bring Him<br/>
And glad hosannas sing Him,<br/>
Naught else your love is worth.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, ye drooping mourners!<br/>
The King is very near;<br/>
Away with grief and sorrow,<br/>
For lo! your Help is here.<br/>
Behold, in many a place—<br/>
We find Him, our Salvation,<br/>
O blessed consolation!<br/>
In His pure means of grace.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, ye much afflicted!<br/>
The King is now not far;<br/>
Rejoice, ye long dejected!<br/>
Here comes the Morning Star.<br/>
The Lord will give you joy;<br/>
Though troubles now distress you,<br/>
With comfort He will bless you,<br/>
E’en death He will destroy.<br/>
<br/>
Now hear, ye bold transgressors,<br/>
The King does well give heed<br/>
To all that ye are doing,<br/>
And to the life ye lead,<br/>
Enthralled to sin and hell;<br/>
Nothing in all creation<br/>
Escapes His observation<br/>
He marketh all things well.<br/>
<br/>
Be righteous, ye His subjects,<br/>
The King is just and true;<br/>
Prepare for Him a highway,<br/>
Make all things straight and new.<br/>
He means all for our good<br/>
Then let us bear our crosses<br/>
That He Himself imposes,<br/>
In an undaunted mood.<br/>
<br/>
Though war and conflagration<br/>
Take all our goods away;<br/>
The Lord is our salvation<br/>
And heritage for aye.<br/>
E’en though our loved ones die,<br/>
Yet they are not forsaken,<br/>
But from this world are taken<br/>
To live with God on high<br/>
<br/>
Arise, ye poor and needy!<br/>
The King provides for you;<br/>
He comes with succor speedy,<br/>
With mercy ever new.<br/>
He Who a beast did heed<br/>
Lets not His children perish;<br/>
All hopes that man may cherish<br/>
He can fulfill indeed.<br/>
<br/>
He nevermore forsaketh<br/>
A child that feels the rod,<br/>
Who Him his refuge maketh,<br/>
And puts his trust in God.<br/>
He is our sovereign King;<br/>
E’en death itself shall never<br/>
Those from their Master sever<br/>
Who to His mercy cling.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, ye faint and fearful!<br/>
The King now comes with might,<br/>
His heart hath long since loved us,<br/>
He makes our darkness light.<br/>
Now are our sorrows o’er;<br/>
No wrath shall e’er befall us,<br/>
Since God in grace doth call us<br/>
His children evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Haste then, with eager footsteps,<br/>
To see your Sovereign there!<br/>
He rides as King of Zion,<br/>
Strong, glorious, meek and fair.<br/>
Draw near the Lord and give<br/>
To Him your salutation,<br/>
Who bringeth great salvation,<br/>
And bids the sinner live.<br/>
<br/>
The King in grace remembers<br/>
His loved ones here below<br/>
With gifts of royal treasures,<br/>
Yea, doth Himself bestow<br/>
Through His blest Word and grace.<br/>
O King, arrayed in splendor,<br/>
To Thee all praise we’ll render<br/>
Here and there face to face.<br/>
<br/>
O rich the gifts Thou bring’st us,<br/>
Thyself made poor and weak;<br/>
O Love beyond expression<br/>
That thus can sinners seek!<br/>
For this, O Lord, will we<br/>
Our joyous tribute bring Thee,<br/>
And glad hosannas sing Thee,<br/>
And ever grateful be.<br/>
