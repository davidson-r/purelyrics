<br/>
Arise, the kingdom is at hand,<br/>
The King is drawing nigh;<br/>
Arise with joy, thou faithful band,<br/>
To meet the Lord most high!<br/>
Look up, ye souls, weighed down with care,<br/>
The Sovereign is not far;<br/>
Look up, faint hearts, from your despair,<br/>
Behold the Morning Star!<br/>
<br/>
Look up, ye drooping hearts, today,<br/>
The King is very near;<br/>
O cast your griefs and fears away,<br/>
For, lo, your help is here!<br/>
Hope on, ye broken hearts, at last<br/>
The King comes in His might;<br/>
He loved us in the ages past<br/>
When we lay wrapped in night.<br/>
<br/>
Look up, ye souls weighed down with care,<br/>
The Sovereign is not far!<br/>
Look up, faint hearts, from your despair,<br/>
Behold the Morning Star!<br/>
The Lord is with us now, Who shall<br/>
The sinking spirit feed<br/>
With strength and comfort at its need<br/>
To Whom e’en death shall bow.<br/>
<br/>
Hope, O ye broken hearts, at last!<br/>
The King comes on in might,<br/>
He loved us in the ages past<br/>
When we sat wrapped in night;<br/>
Now are our sorrows o’er, and fear<br/>
And wrath to joy give place,<br/>
Since God hath made us in His grace<br/>
His children evermore.<br/>
<br/>
O rich the gifts Thou bringest us,<br/>
Thyself made poor and weak;<br/>
O love beyond compare that thus<br/>
Can foes and sinners seek!<br/>
For this we raise a gladsome voice<br/>
On high to Thee alone,<br/>
And evermore with thanks rejoice<br/>
Before Thy glorious throne.<br/>
