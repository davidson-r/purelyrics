title: Awake My Soul And With The Sun

<center>
Awake, my soul, and with the sun<br/>
Thy daily stage of duty run;<br/>
Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise,<br/>
To pay thy morning sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Thy precious time misspent, redeem,<br/>
Each present day thy last esteem,<br/>
Improve thy talent with due care;<br/>
For the great day thyself prepare.<br/>
<br/>
By influence of the Light divine<br/>
Let thy own light to others shine.<br/>
Reflect all Heaven’s propitious ways<br/>
In ardent love, and cheerful praise.<br/>
<br/>
In conversation be sincere;<br/>
Keep conscience as the noontide clear;<br/>
Think how all seeing God thy ways<br/>
And all thy secret thoughts surveys.<br/>
<br/>
Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,<br/>
And with the angels bear thy part,<br/>
Who all night long unwearied sing<br/>
High praise to the eternal King.<br/>
<br/>
All praise to Thee, Who safe has kept<br/>
And hast refreshed me while I slept<br/>
Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake<br/>
I may of endless light partake.<br/>
<br/>
Heav’n is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art,<br/>
O never then from me depart;<br/>
For to my soul ’tis hell to be<br/>
But for one moment void of Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;<br/>
Disperse my sins as morning dew.<br/>
Guard my first springs of thought and will,<br/>
And with Thyself my spirit fill.<br/>
<br/>
Direct, control, suggest, this day,<br/>
All I design, or do, or say,<br/>
That all my powers, with all their might,<br/>
In Thy sole glory may unite.<br/>
<br/>
I would not wake nor rise again<br/>
And Heaven itself I would disdain,<br/>
Wert Thou not there to be enjoyed,<br/>
And I in hymns to be employed.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven is, dear Lord, where’er Thou art;<br/>
O never then from me depart;<br/>
For to my soul ’tis hell to be<br/>
But for one moment without Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;<br/>
Praise Him, all creatures here below;<br/>
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;<br/>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
