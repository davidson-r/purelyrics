<center>
<br/>
The ancient law departs,<br/>
And all its terrors cease;<br/>
For Jesus makes with faithful hearts<br/>
A covenant of peace.<br/>
<br/>
The Light of Light divine,<br/>
True brightness undefiled,<br/>
He bears for us the shame of sin,<br/>
A holy, spotless Child.<br/>
<br/>
His infant body now<br/>
Begins our pains to feel;<br/>
Those precious drops of blood that flow<br/>
For death the victim seal.<br/>
<br/>
Today the Name is Thine,<br/>
At which we bend the knee;<br/>
They call Thee Jesus, Child divine!<br/>
Our Jesus deign to be.<br/>
