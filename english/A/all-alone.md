<br/>
Have you ever tried to bear your burdens<br/>
All alone? All alone?<br/>
Don’t you know there’s One who waits to help you,<br/>
Who will make all your burdens His own?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When I have burdens to bear which no one can share,<br/>
I take them to Jesus, the Man of Calvary;<br/>
When I have crosses to bear, my Savior is there,<br/>
And always takes the heavy end, and gives the light to me.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t you know He trod the winepress for you?<br/>
All alone? All alone?<br/>
And the burden that He bore in meekness,<br/>
Such a burden no other has known.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Don’t you know that He has bought your pardon<br/>
All alone? All alone?<br/>
And your gratitude for such a mercy<br/>
Unto Jesus you never have shown.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
