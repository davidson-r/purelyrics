title: All The Sacrifice Is Ended

<center>
All the sacrifice is ended,<br/>
Breathed His body’s latest breath,<br/>
And His human Soul hath wended<br/>
Where the weary rest beneath;<br/>
Christ as Man hath comprehended<br/>
All the human law of death!<br/>
<br/>
Yet not there His Soul remaineth<br/>
Nor His body in the tomb:<br/>
Lo! what sudden glory gaineth<br/>
Quick dominion o’er the gloom!<br/>
Yea, o’er death and hell He reigneth<br/>
Bursting back the gates of doom!<br/>
<br/>
Manifold the attestation<br/>
Brethren tell the marvel o’er,<br/>
And the soldiers from their station,<br/>
And the angels at the door,<br/>
And His own Word’s revelation,<br/>
“Lo! I live for evermore.”<br/>
<br/>
Hail, thou morn of resurrection,<br/>
Primal holy Easter Day!<br/>
Now the hours of deep dejection<br/>
’Neath the night-clouds’ dark array,<br/>
Foes’ reviling, friends’ defection,<br/>
In thy glory pass away!<br/>
<br/>
Now He lives and reigns for ever!<br/>
That we too may enter in<br/>
Where eternal life shall never<br/>
Taste of sorrow or of sin,<br/>
Where from Him no death shall sever<br/>
Those He vanquished death to win.<br/>
<br/>
Savior! in our night of weeping<br/>
Tell us of the joyful morn,<br/>
Guard our souls, their vigil keeping<br/>
In the hours of hate and scorn<br/>
Raise us falling, wake us sleeping,<br/>
Till our Easter Day be born.
