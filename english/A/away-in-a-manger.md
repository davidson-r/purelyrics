title: Away in a Manger

<br/>
Away in a manger,<br/>
No crib for His bed<br/>
The little Lord Jesus<br/>
Laid down His sweet head<br/>
<br/>
The stars in the bright sky<br/>
Looked down where He lay<br/>
The little Lord Jesus<br/>
Asleep on the hay<br/>
<br/>
The cattle are lowing<br/>
The poor Baby wakes<br/>
But little Lord Jesus<br/>
No crying He makes<br/>
<br/>
I love Thee, Lord Jesus<br/>
Look down from the sky<br/>
And stay by my side,<br/>
'Til morning is nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Be near me, Lord Jesus,<br/>
I ask Thee to stay<br/>
Close by me forever<br/>
And love me I pray<br/>
<br/>
Bless all the dear children<br/>
In Thy tender care<br/>
And take us to heaven<br/>
To live with Thee there.<br/>
