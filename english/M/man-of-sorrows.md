<br/>
Man of Sorrows! what a name<br/>
For the Son of God, who came<br/>
Ruined sinners to reclaim.<br/>
Hallelujah! What a Savior!<br/>
<br/>
Bearing shame and scoffing rude,<br/>
In my place condemned He stood;<br/>
Sealed my pardon with His blood.<br/>
Hallelujah! What a Savior!<br/>
<br/>
Guilty, vile, and helpless we;<br/>
Spotless Lamb of God was He;<br/>
“Full atonement!” can it be?<br/>
Hallelujah! What a Savior!<br/>
<br/>
Lifted up was He to die;<br/>
“It is finished!” was His cry;<br/>
Now in Heav’n exalted high.<br/>
Hallelujah! What a Savior!<br/>
<br/>
When He comes, our glorious King,<br/>
All His ransomed home to bring,<br/>
Then anew His song we’ll sing:<br/>
Hallelujah! What a Savior!<br/>
