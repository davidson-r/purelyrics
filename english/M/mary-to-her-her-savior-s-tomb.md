<br/>
Mary to her Savior’s tomb<br/>
Hasted at the early dawn;<br/>
Spice she brought, and sweet perfume,<br/>
But the Lord, the Loved, was gone.<br/>
<br/>
For awhile she weeping stood,<br/>
Struck with sorrow and surprise;<br/>
Shedding tears, a plenteous flood,<br/>
For her heart supplied her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Who is always near,<br/>
Though too often unperceived<br/>
Came, His drooping child to cheer,<br/>
And inquired, Why she grieved?<br/>
<br/>
Though at first she knew Him not,<br/>
When He called her by her name,<br/>
Then her griefs were all forgot,<br/>
For she found He was the same.<br/>
<br/>
Grief and sighing quickly fled<br/>
When she heard His welcome voice;<br/>
Just before she thought Him dead,<br/>
Now He bids her heart rejoice:<br/>
<br/>
What a change His Word can make,<br/>
Turning darkness into day!<br/>
You who weep for Jesus’ sake;<br/>
He will wipe your tears away.<br/>
<br/>
He Who came to comfort her,<br/>
When she thought her all was lost;<br/>
Will for your relief appear,<br/>
Though you now are tempest-tossed:<br/>
<br/>
On His Word your burden cast,<br/>
On His love your thoughts employ;<br/>
Weeping for awhile may last,<br/>
But the morning brings the joy.<br/>
