Morn of morns, and day of days!<br/>
Beauteous were thy newborn rays:<br/>
Brighter yet from deathâ€™s dark prison<br/>
Christ, the Light of lights, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
He commanded, and His Word<br/>
Death and the dread chaos heard;<br/>
Oh, shall we, more deaf than they,<br/>
In the chains of darkness stay?<br/>
<br/>
Nature yet in shadow lies;<br/>
Let the sons of light arise,<br/>
And present the morning rays<br/>
With sweet canticles of praise.<br/>
<br/>
While the dead world sleeps around,<br/>
Let the sacred temples sound<br/>
Law, and prophet, and blest psalm<br/>
Lit with holy light so calm.<br/>
<br/>
Unto hearts in slumber weak<br/>
Let the heavenly trumpet speak;<br/>
And a newer walk express<br/>
Their new life to righteousness.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us this, and with us be,<br/>
O Thou Fount of charity,<br/>
Thou Who dost the Spirit give,<br/>
Bidding the dead letter live.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to the Father, Son,<br/>
And to Thee, O Holy One,<br/>
By Whose quickening breath divine<br/>
Our dull spirits turn and shine.
