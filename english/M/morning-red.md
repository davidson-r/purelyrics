<br/>
Morning red, morning red,<br/>
Now the shadows all are fled;<br/>
Now the Sabbathâ€™s cloudless glory,<br/>
Tells anew the wondrous story,<br/>
Christ is risen from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
All around, all around,<br/>
Solemn silence reigned profound;<br/>
When, with blaze and sudden thunder,<br/>
Angels burst the tomb asunder,<br/>
And the Savior was unbound.<br/>
<br/>
Forth He came! Forth He came!<br/>
Robed in white, celestial flame!<br/>
Mary, at the empty prison,<br/>
Knew not her Redeemer risen<br/>
Till He called her by her name.<br/>
<br/>
Morning red! Morning red!<br/>
Christ is risen from the dead!<br/>
Still He walketh in the garden,<br/>
Speaking words of love and pardon.<br/>
Though the crown is on His head.<br/>
