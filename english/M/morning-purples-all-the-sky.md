title: Morning Purples All The Sky

<center>
The morning purples all the sky,<br/>
The air with praises rings,<br/>
Defeated hell stands sullen by,<br/>
The world exulting sings.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God! our glad lips cry;<br/>
All praise and worship be<br/>
On earth, in heaven, to God most high,<br/>
For Christ’s great victory,<br/>
For Christ’s great victory.<br/>
<br/>
While He, the King all strong to save,<br/>
Rends the dark doors away,<br/>
And through the breaches of the grave,<br/>
Strides forth into the day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Death’s captive, in his gloomy prison,<br/>
Fast fettered He has lain,<br/>
But He has mastered death, is risen,<br/>
And death now wears the chain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The shining angels cry, “Away<br/>
With grief; no spices bring;<br/>
Not tears, but songs, this joyful day,<br/>
Should greet the rising King!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
That Thou our Paschal Lamb may’st be,<br/>
And endless joy begin.<br/>
Jesus, Deliverer, set us free<br/>
From the dread death of sin.<br/>
<br/>
