title: My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less

<center>
My hope is built on nothing less<br/>
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.<br/>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br/>
But wholly trust in Jesus’ Name.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
On Christ the solid Rock I stand,<br/>
All other ground is sinking sand;<br/>
All other ground is sinking sand.<br/>
<br/>
When darkness seems to hide His face,<br/>
I rest on His unchanging grace.<br/>
In every high and stormy gale,<br/>
My anchor holds within the veil.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
His oath, His covenant, His blood,<br/>
Support me in the whelming flood.<br/>
When all around my soul gives way,<br/>
He then is all my Hope and Stay.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br/>
Oh may I then in Him be found.<br/>
Dressed in His righteousness alone,<br/>
Faultless to stand before the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
