<br/>
My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;<br/>
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.<br/>
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;<br/>
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.<br/>
<br/>
I love Thee because Thou has first loved me,<br/>
And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree.<br/>
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;<br/>
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,<br/>
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;<br/>
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,<br/>
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.<br/>
<br/>
In mansions of glory and endless delight,<br/>
I’ll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;<br/>
I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow;<br/>
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.<br/>
