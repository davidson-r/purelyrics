<br/>
Members of Christ are we;<br/>
He is our living Head.<br/>
That henceforth we should ever be<br/>
By His good Spirit led<br/>
In the same narrow path<br/>
Our Lord and Savior trod—<br/>
The path that leadeth by the cross<br/>
To glory and to God.<br/>
<br/>
Children of God are we;<br/>
Such grace to us is given,<br/>
To kneel and pray in Christ’s own words,<br/>
“Father, Which art in Heav’n”;<br/>
Seeking to do His will<br/>
As angels do above,<br/>
And walking in obedient ways<br/>
Of holy truth and love.<br/>
<br/>
Of Heaven’s kingdom we<br/>
Inheritors were made;<br/>
Each at the font in Christ’s own robe<br/>
Of spotless white arrayed.<br/>
Upon our forehead now<br/>
Is traced the suffering sign,<br/>
That one day on each saintly brow<br/>
A glorious crown may shine.<br/>
<br/>
Christ’s little ones are we;<br/>
And unto us are given<br/>
Angelic guards, who ever see<br/>
Our Father’s face in Heav’n.<br/>
To walk in folly now<br/>
We may not, must not, dare,<br/>
Mindful Whose seal is on our brow,<br/>
Whose holy Name we bear.<br/>
