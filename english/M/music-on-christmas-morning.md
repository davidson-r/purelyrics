title: Music on Christmas morning

<center>
Music I love but ne’er a strain<br/>
Could kindle raptures so divine,<br/>
So grief assuage, so conquer pain,<br/>
And rouse this pensive heart of mine;<br/>
As that we hear on Christmas morn,<br/>
Upon the wintry breezes borne.<br/>
<br/>
Though darkness still her empire keep,<br/>
And hours must pass, ere morning break;<br/>
From troubled dreams, or slumbers deep,<br/>
That music kindly bids us wake:<br/>
It calls us, with an angel’s voice,<br/>
To wake, and worship, and rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
To greet with joy the glorious morn,<br/>
Which angels welcomed long ago,<br/>
When our redeeming Lord was born,<br/>
To bring the light of Heaven below;<br/>
The powers of darkness to dispel,<br/>
And rescue Earth from death and hell.<br/>
<br/>
While listening to that sacred strain,<br/>
My raptured spirit soars on high;<br/>
I seem to hear those songs again<br/>
Resounding through the open sky,<br/>
That kindled such divine delight,<br/>
In those who watched their flocks by night.<br/>
<br/>
With them, I celebrate His birth;<br/>
Glory to God, in highest Heaven,<br/>
Good will to men, and peace on Earth,<br/>
To us a Savior King is given;<br/>
Our God is come to claim His own,<br/>
And Satan’s power is overthrown!<br/>
<br/>
A sinless God, for sinful men,<br/>
Descends to suffer and to bleed;<br/>
Hell must renounce its empire then;<br/>
The price is paid, the world is freed,<br/>
And Satan’s self must now confess,<br/>
That Christ has earned a right to bless.<br/>
<br/>
Now holy peace may smile from Heaven,<br/>
And heavenly truth from earth shall spring:<br/>
The captive’s galling bonds are riven,<br/>
For our Redeemer is our King;<br/>
And He that gave His blood for men<br/>
Will lead us home to God again.
