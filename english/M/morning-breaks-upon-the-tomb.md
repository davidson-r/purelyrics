title: Morning Breaks Upon The Tomb

<center>
<br/>
Morning breaks upon the tomb;<br/>
Jesus scatters all its gloom.<br/>
Day of triumph through the skies;<br/>
See the glorious Savior rise.<br/>
<br/>
Ye who are of death afraid<br/>
Triumph in the scattered shade.<br/>
Drive your anxious cares away;<br/>
See the place where Jesus lay.<br/>
<br/>
Christians, dry your flowing tears<br/>
Chase your unbelieving fears;<br/>
Look on His deserted grave,<br/>
Doubt no more His power to save.<br/>
