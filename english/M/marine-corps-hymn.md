<br/>
From the Halls of Montezuma<br/>
To the Shores of Tripoli;<br/>
We fight our country's battles<br/>
In the air, on land and sea;<br/>
First to fight for right and freedom <br/>
And to keep our honor clean; <br/>
We are proud to claim the title <br/>
of United States Marine. <br/>
<br/>
Our flag's unfurled to every breeze<br/>
From dawn to setting sun;<br/>
We have fought in ev'ry clime and place<br/>
Where we could take a gun;<br/>
In the snow of far-off Northern lands<br/>
And in sunny tropic scenes; <br/>
You will find us always on the job<br/>
The United States Marines. <br/>
<br/>
Here's health to you and to our Corps<br/>
Which we are proud to serve <br/>
In many a strife we've fought for life <br/>
And never lost our nerve;<br/>
If the Army and the Navy<br/>
Ever look on Heaven's scenes; <br/>
They will find the streets are guarded <br/>
By United States Marines. <br/>
