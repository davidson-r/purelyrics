<br/>
My song is love unknown,<br/>
My Savior’s love to me;<br/>
Love to the loveless shown,<br/>
That they might lovely be.<br/>
O who am I, that for my sake<br/>
My Lord should take, frail flesh and die?<br/>
<br/>
He came from His blest throne<br/>
Salvation to bestow;<br/>
But men made strange, and none<br/>
The longed for Christ would know:<br/>
But O! my Friend, my Friend indeed,<br/>
Who at my need His life did spend.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they strew His way,<br/>
And His sweet praises sing;<br/>
Resounding all the day<br/>
Hosannas to their King:<br/>
Then “Crucify!” is all their breath,<br/>
And for His death they thirst and cry.<br/>
<br/>
Why, what hath my Lord done?<br/>
What makes this rage and spite?<br/>
He made the lame to run,<br/>
He gave the blind their sight,<br/>
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these<br/>
Themselves displease, and ’gainst Him rise.<br/>
<br/>
They rise and needs will have<br/>
My dear Lord made away;<br/>
A murderer they saved,<br/>
The Prince of life they slay,<br/>
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes,<br/>
That He His foes from thence might free.<br/>
<br/>
In life, no house, no home<br/>
My Lord on earth might have;<br/>
In death no friendly tomb<br/>
But what a stranger gave.<br/>
What may I say? Heav’n was His home;<br/>
But mine the tomb wherein He lay.<br/>
<br/>
Here might I stay and sing,<br/>
No story so divine;<br/>
Never was love, dear King!<br/>
Never was grief like Thine.<br/>
This is my Friend, in Whose sweet praise<br/>
I all my days could gladly spend.<br/>
