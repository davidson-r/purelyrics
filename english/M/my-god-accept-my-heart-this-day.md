<br/>
My God, accept my heart this day,<br/>
And make it always Thine,<br/>
That I from Thee no more may stray,<br/>
No more from Thee decline.<br/>
<br/>
Before the cross of Him Who died,<br/>
Behold, I prostrate fall;<br/>
Let every sin be crucified,<br/>
Let Christ be all in all.<br/>
<br/>
Anoint me with Thy heavenly grace,<br/>
Adopt me for Thine own,<br/>
That I may see Thy glorious face,<br/>
And worship at Thy throne.<br/>
<br/>
May the dear blood once shed for me<br/>
My blest atonement prove<br/>
That I from first to last may be<br/>
The purchase of Thy love!<br/>
<br/>
Let every thought, and work, and word,<br/>
To Thee be ever given;<br/>
Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,<br/>
And death the gate of Heaven.<br/>
