<br/>
My God, I thank Thee, Who hast made<br/>
The earth so bright,<br/>
So full of splendor and of joy,<br/>
Beauty and light;<br/>
So many glorious things are here,<br/>
Noble and right.<br/>
<br/>
I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made<br/>
Joy to abound;<br/>
So many gentle thoughts and deeds<br/>
Circling us round,<br/>
That in the darkest spot of earth<br/>
Some love is found.<br/>
<br/>
I thank Thee more that all our joy<br/>
Is touched with pain,<br/>
That shadows fall on brightest hours,<br/>
That thorns remain;<br/>
So that earth’s bliss may be our guide,<br/>
And not our chain.<br/>
<br/>
For thou who knowest, Lord, how soon<br/>
Our weak heart clings,<br/>
Hast given us joys, tender and true,<br/>
Yet all with wings;<br/>
So that we see gleaming on high<br/>
Diviner things.<br/>
<br/>
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept<br/>
The best in store;<br/>
We have enough, yet not too much<br/>
To long for more:<br/>
A yearning for a deeper peace<br/>
Not known before.<br/>
<br/>
I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls<br/>
Though amply blessed,<br/>
Can never find, although they seek<br/>
A perfect rest;<br/>
Nor ever shall, until they lean<br/>
On Jesus’ breast.<br/>
