<br/>
Mortals, awake, with angels join,<br/>
And chant the solemn lay,<br/>
Joy, love, and gratitude combine,<br/>
To hail the auspicious day,<br/>
To hail the auspicious day.<br/>
<br/>
In Heav’n the rapturous song began,<br/>
And sweet seraphic fire<br/>
Through all the shining legions ran,<br/>
And strung and tuned the lyre,<br/>
And strung and tuned the lyre.<br/>
<br/>
Swift through the vast expanse it flew,<br/>
And loud the echo rolled,<br/>
The theme, the song, the joy, was new—<br/>
’Twas more than Heav’n could hold,<br/>
’Twas more than Heav’n could hold.<br/>
<br/>
Down through the portals of the sky<br/>
The impetuous torrent ran;<br/>
And angels flew, with eager joy,<br/>
To bear the news to man,<br/>
To bear the news to man.<br/>
<br/>
Hark! the cherubic armies shout,<br/>
And glory leads the song:<br/>
Good will and peace are heard throughout<br/>
The harmonious heav’nly throng,<br/>
The harmonious heav’nly throng.<br/>
<br/>
With joy the chorus we repeat,<br/>
“Glory to God on high!”<br/>
Good will and peace are now complete,<br/>
Jesus was born to die,<br/>
Jesus was born to die.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, Prince of Life, forever hail!<br/>
Redeemer, Brother, Friend!<br/>
Though earth, and time, and life shall fail<br/>
Thy praise shall never end,<br/>
Thy praise shall never end.<br/>
