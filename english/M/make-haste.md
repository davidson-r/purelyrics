title: Make haste

<br/>
A storm gathers dark o’er the foam crested deep,<br/>
And souls on the billows are tossed;<br/>
Then forth let us go, with a message of hope,<br/>
Speed on, lest their vessel be lost.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Make haste, make haste,<br/>
Make haste to the rescue, away!<br/>
Speed on, quickly on, with a message of hope—<br/>
No time for a moment’s delay.<br/>
<br/>
No bright beaming star in the darkness they see,<br/>
No bells from the harbor they hear;<br/>
Their frail, shattered bark, still is drifting afar,<br/>
Speed on, with a message of cheer.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
A light softly breaks, and their peril is o’er;<br/>
They hear, and they answer our call;<br/>
Our boat hurries on with the Pilot on board—<br/>
In Him is a refuge for all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
