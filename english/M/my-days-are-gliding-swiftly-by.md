title: My Days Are Gliding Swiftly By

<br/>
My days are gliding swiftly by;<br/>
And I, a pilgrim stranger,<br/>
Would not detain them as they fly,<br/>
Those hours of toil and labor.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For, oh! we stand on Jordan’s strand;<br/>
Our friends are passing over;<br/>
And, just before, the shining shore<br/>
We may almost discover.<br/>
<br/>
We’ll gird our loins, my brethren dear,<br/>
Our distant home discerning:<br/>
Our waiting Lord has left us word,<br/>
Let ev’ry lamp be burning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Should coming days be cold and dark,<br/>
We need not cease our singing:<br/>
That perfect rest naught can molest,<br/>
Where golden harps are ringing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Let sorrow’s rudest tempest blow,<br/>
Each cord on earth to sever:<br/>
Our King says, “Come,” and there’s our home,<br/>
Forever, oh! forever.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
