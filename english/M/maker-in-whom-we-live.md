title: Maker in Whom We Live

Maker, in whom we live, in whom we are and move, <br/>
the glory, power, and praise receive for thy creating love. <br/>
Let all the angel throng give thanks to God on high, <br/>
while earth repeats the joyful song and echoes to the sky. <br/>
<br/>
Incarnate Deity, let all the ransomed race <br/>
render in thanks their lives to thee for thy redeeming grace. <br/>
The grace to sinners showed ye heavenly choirs proclaim, <br/>
and cry, "Salvation to our God, salvation to the Lamb!" <br/>
<br/>
Spirit of Holiness, let all thy saints adore <br/>
thy sacred energy, and bless thine heart-renewing power. <br/>
No angel tongues can tell thy love's ecstatic height, <br/>
the glorious joy unspeakable, the beatific sight. <br/>
<br/>
Eternal, Triune God, let all the hosts above, <br/>
let all on earth below record and dwell upon thy love. <br/>
When heaven and earth are fled before thy glorious face, <br/>
sing all the saints thy love hath made thine everlasting praise.
