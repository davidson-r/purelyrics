title: Morning Light Is Breaking

<center>
<br/>
The morning light is breaking, the darkness disappears;<br/>
The sons of earth are waking, to penitential tears;<br/>
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean brings tidings from afar<br/>
Of nations in commotion, prepared for Zion’s war.<br/>
<br/>
Rich dews of grace come o’er us, in many a gentle shower,<br/>
And brighter scenes before us, are opening every hour;<br/>
Each cry to heaven going, abundant answers brings,<br/>
And heavenly winds are blowing, with peace upon their wings.<br/>
<br/>
See heathen nations bending before the God we love,<br/>
And thousand hearts ascending in gratitude above:<br/>
While sinners, now confessing, the Gospel call obey,<br/>
And seek the Savior’s blessing, a nation in a day.<br/>
<br/>
Blest river of salvation, pursue thy onward way;<br/>
Flow thou to every nation, nor in thy riches stay:<br/>
Stay not till all the lowly triumphant reach their home;<br/>
Stay not till all the holy proclaim, “The Lord is come.”<br/>
