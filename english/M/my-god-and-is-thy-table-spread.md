<center>
My God, and is thy table spread,<br/>
and doth thy cup with love o'erflow?<br/>
Thither be all thy children led,<br/>
and let them thy sweetness know.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, sacred feast, which Jesus makes,<br/>
rich banquet of his Flesh and Blood!<br/>
Thrice happy he who here partakes<br/>
that sacred stream, that heavenly food.<br/>
<br/>
Why are its bounties all in vain<br/>
before unwilling hearts displayed?<br/>
Was not for them the Victim slain?<br/>
Are they forbid the children's bread?<br/>
<br/>
O let thy table honored be,<br/>
and furnished well with joyful guests;<br/>
and may each soul salvation see<br/>
that here its sacred pledges tastes.
</center>
