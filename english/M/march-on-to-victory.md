<br/>
Enlisted in the Christian ranks,<br/>
A faithful soldier be,<br/>
And side by side with loyal ones<br/>
March on (march on) to victory.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
March on (march on) to victory,<br/>
March on (march on) to victory;<br/>
Beneath the banner of the Lord<br/>
March on (march on) to victory (march on).<br/>
<br/>
The conflict may be hard and long,<br/>
But triumph is assured,<br/>
And Heaven holds a rich reward<br/>
For tri(trials) als here endured.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Relying on the Lord of Hosts,<br/>
March on to conquer sin,<br/>
And to your Leader gladly bear<br/>
Each trophy that you win.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The joy of conquest will be yours,<br/>
When you have overcome,<br/>
And after warfare, rest and peace<br/>
Await (await) in Godâ€™s bright home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
