<br/>
Mother of God, and daughter of thy Son, yet mother mine;<br/>
The Lady of thy Lord, the Holy One, thy Child Divine;<br/>
Show me thy wondrous Babe, O Mother Maid, foretold of yore;<br/>
The treasure on thy virgin bosom laid let me adore. <br/>
<br/>
Mother of God, commend me to thy Son, as here I bend;<br/>
And O, commend me when my task is done and life shall end;<br/>
Within thy out stretched hands I leave my heart, pure Maid, with thee;<br/>
A worthless gift from which thou wilt not part eternally. <br/>
