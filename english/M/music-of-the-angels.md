title: Music of the Angels

<center>
<br/>
The evergreen branches are waving around us,<br/>
And sweetly our carols in harmony ring,<br/>
While here we are gathered to welcome with rapture<br/>
The birth of our Savior, Redeemer, and King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hark! the music of the angels<br/>
Floating onward still we hear;<br/>
Bless√®d music, sweetest chorus<br/>
Ever sung to mortal ear.<br/>
<br/>
How graciously favored the shepherds of Judah,<br/>
Who guarded their flocks on that wonderful morn,<br/>
When legions descended, proclaiming the tidings<br/>
That Jesus, the promised Redeemer, was born.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How humble His birthplace, how lowly His cradle,<br/>
O tender compassion, O infinite love!<br/>
The Son of the Highest our nature assuming<br/>
That we might inherit the mansions above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The sweet chiming bells with our carols are blending,<br/>
A glad, merry Christmas they joyfully ring.<br/>
While here we are gathered to welcome with rapture<br/>
The birth of our Savior, Redeemer, and King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
