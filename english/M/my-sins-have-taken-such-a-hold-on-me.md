<br/>
My sins have taken such a hold on me,<br/>
I am not able to look up to Thee;<br/>
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:<br/>
But Thou hast taken all my sins away,<br/>
And I in Thee dare now look up and pray:<br/>
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.<br/>
<br/>
Of nights unhallowed, and of sinful days,<br/>
Of careless thoughts and words and works and way,<br/>
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:<br/>
And in the life which doth within me live,<br/>
And the forgiveness which can all forgive,<br/>
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.<br/>
<br/>
Of selfishness which makes the soul unjust,<br/>
Envy and strife and every sinful lust,<br/>
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:<br/>
And in the blood, which doth my pardon plead,<br/>
The truth and love, which for me intercede,<br/>
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.<br/>
<br/>
Of sins that as a cloud have hid Thy face,<br/>
Of Thy care slighted, and thy grievèd grace,<br/>
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:<br/>
In Love, that puts sin’s envious veil aside,<br/>
Rending the veil of flesh which for me died,<br/>
Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.<br/>
<br/>
For sin I mourn, the sin that gave Thee pain;<br/>
Thine was the burden, mine alone the stain;<br/>
Lord, I repent; accept my tears and grief:<br/>
Christ is my joy; and out of all distress<br/>
He doth deliver with His righteousness:<br/>
Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.<br/>
