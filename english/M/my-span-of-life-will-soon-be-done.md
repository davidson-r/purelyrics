title: My Span Of Life Will Soon Be Done

<br/>
My span of life will soon be done,<br/>
The passing moments say;<br/>
As lengthening shadows oâ€™er the mead<br/>
Proclaim the close of day.<br/>
<br/>
O that my heart might dwell aloof<br/>
From all created things,<br/>
And learn that wisdom from above<br/>
Whence true contentment springs!<br/>
<br/>
Courage, my soul! thy bitter cross,<br/>
In every trial here,<br/>
Shall bear thee to thy heaven above,<br/>
But shall not enter there.<br/>
<br/>
Courage, my soul, on God rely;<br/>
Deliverance soon will come;<br/>
A thousand ways has Providence<br/>
To bring believers home.<br/>
