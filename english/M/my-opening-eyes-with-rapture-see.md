title: My Opening Eyes With Rapture See

<center>
<br/>
My opening eyes with rapture see<br/>
The dawn of this returning day;<br/>
My thoughts, O God, ascend to Thee,<br/>
While thus my early vows I pay.<br/>
<br/>
I yield my heart to Thee alone,<br/>
Nor would receive another guest:<br/>
Eternal King, erect Thy throne,<br/>
And reign sole monarch in my breast.<br/>
<br/>
O bid this trifling world retire,<br/>
And drive each carnal thought away;<br/>
Nor let me feel one vain desire,<br/>
One sinful thought, through all the day.<br/>
<br/>
Then, to Thy courts when I repair,<br/>
My soul shall rise on joyful wing,<br/>
The wonders of Thy love declare,<br/>
And join the strains which angels sing.<br/>
