Mighty army of the young,<br/>
Lift your voice in cheerful song,<br/>
Send the welcome word along,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
Once He died for you and me,<br/>
Bore our sins upon the tree,<br/>
Now He lives to make us free,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Wait not till the shadows lengthen, till you older grow,<br/>
Rally now and sing for Jesus, ev’rywhere you go;<br/>
Lift your joyful voices high,<br/>
Ringing clear thro’ earth and sky,<br/>
Let the blessèd tidings fly,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
<br/>
Voice of youth so glad and free,<br/>
Sing your song of victory;<br/>
Sing to all on land and sea,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
Light for you and all mankind,<br/>
Sight of all by sin made blind,<br/>
Life in Jesus all may find,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus lives, O blessèd words!<br/>
King of kings, and Lord of lords!<br/>
Lift the cross and sheathe the swords,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
See, He breaks the prison wall,<br/>
Throws aside the dreadful pall,<br/>
Conquers death at once for all,<br/>
Jesus lives!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
