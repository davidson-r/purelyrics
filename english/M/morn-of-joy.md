Morn of joy and morn of praise!<br/>
Brightest day of all the days,<br/>
For the Lord is risen, is risen!<br/>
Lo! they come at break of day,<br/>
Find the great stone rolled away;<br/>
Hark! and hear the angel say,<br/>
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Morn of gladness, morn of light!<br/>
Fear and gloom are put to flight,<br/>
For the Lord is risen, is risen!<br/>
Now no more the grave we fear,<br/>
For we know “He is not here”;<br/>
But the angel speaks good cheer,<br/>
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O, what brightness from the Lord,<br/>
Shines within His blessèd Word,<br/>
For the Lord is risen, is risen!<br/>
Telling of the world of light,<br/>
Where there is no death nor night,<br/>
Where, on Easter morning bright,<br/>
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thither, too, O may we rise,<br/>
When this earthly body dies,<br/>
Where our Lord is risen, is risen!<br/>
Strive we, then, in each new day,<br/>
All that’s wrong to put away;<br/>
So shall we rejoicing say,<br/>
The Lord, the Lord is risen, is risen.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
