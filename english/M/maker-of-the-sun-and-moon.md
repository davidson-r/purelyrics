<br/>
The Maker of the sun and moon,<br/>
The Maker of our earth,<br/>
Lo! late in time, a fairer boon,<br/>
Himself is brought to birth!<br/>
<br/>
How blest was all creation then,<br/>
When God so gave increase;<br/>
And Christ, to heal the hearts of men,<br/>
Brought righteousness and peace!<br/>
<br/>
No star in all the heights of heaven<br/>
But burned to see Him go;<br/>
Yet unto earth alone was given<br/>
His human form to know.<br/>
<br/>
His human form, by man denied,<br/>
Took death for human sin:<br/>
His endless love, through faith descried,<br/>
Still lives the world to win.<br/>
<br/>
O perfect love, outpassing sight,<br/>
O light beyond our ken,<br/>
Come down through all the world tonight,<br/>
And heal the hearts of men!<br/>
