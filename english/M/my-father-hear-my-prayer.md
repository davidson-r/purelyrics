<br/>
My Father, hear my prayer<br/>
Before I go to rest;<br/>
It is Thy trustful child<br/>
That cometh to be blest.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me all my sin,<br/>
And let me sleep this night<br/>
In safety and in peace<br/>
Until the morning light.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, help me every day<br/>
To love Thee more and more,<br/>
And try to do Thy will<br/>
Much better than before.<br/>
<br/>
Now look upon me, Lord,<br/>
Ere I lie down to rest;<br/>
It is Thy trustful child<br/>
That cometh to be blest.<br/>
