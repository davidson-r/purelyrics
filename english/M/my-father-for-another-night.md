title: My Father For Another Night

<center>
My Father, for another night<br/>
Of quiet sleep and rest,<br/>
For all the joy of morning light,<br/>
Thy holy Name be blest.<br/>
<br/>
Now with the newborn day I give<br/>
Myself anew to Thee,<br/>
That as Thou willest I may live,<br/>
And what Thou willest be.<br/>
<br/>
Whate’er I do, things great or small,<br/>
Whate’er I speak or frame,<br/>
Thy glory may I seek in all,<br/>
Do all in Jesus’ Name.<br/>
<br/>
My Father, for His sake, I pray<br/>
Thy child accept and bless;<br/>
And lead me by Thy grace today<br/>
In paths of righteousness.
</center>
