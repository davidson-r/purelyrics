<br/>
My country tis of thee,<br/>
Sweet land of liberty,<br/>
Of thee I sing.<br/>
Land where my fathers died!<br/>
Land of the Pilgrim's pride!<br/>
From every mountain side,<br/>
Let freedom ring!<br/>
<br/>
My native country, thee,<br/>
Land of the noble free,<br/>
Thy name I love.<br/>
I love thy rocks and rills,<br/>
Thy woods and templed hills;<br/>
My heart with rapture fills<br/>
Like that above.<br/>
<br/>
Let music swell the breeze,<br/>
And ring from all the trees<br/>
Sweet freedom's song.<br/>
Let mortal tongues awake;<br/>
Let all that breathe partake;<br/>
Let rocks their silence break,<br/>
The sound prolong.<br/>
<br/>
Our father's God to, Thee,<br/>
Author of liberty,<br/>
To Thee we sing.<br/>
Long may our land be bright<br/>
With freedom's holy light;<br/>
Protect us by Thy might,<br/>
Great God, our King!<br/>
