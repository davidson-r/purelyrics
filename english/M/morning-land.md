<center>
O how light to the soul are its crosses,<br/>
And how easy our burdens to bear,<br/>
When we think of that land over Jordan,<br/>
And the joy that will crown us there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O the bright morning land, the dear morning land,<br/>
The land where all sorrow is o’er!<br/>
We shall sit beneath the ray of a golden summer day,<br/>
Where the shadows will return no more.<br/>
<br/>
O how light to the soul are its crosses,<br/>
And the conflicts and trials we meet;<br/>
We shall soon lay down them over Jordan,<br/>
We shall lay them at Jesus’ feet.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O how light to the soul are its crosses,<br/>
O the mercy of Jesus, our Friend!<br/>
We shall praise Him for all over Jordan,<br/>
In our beautiful home beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
