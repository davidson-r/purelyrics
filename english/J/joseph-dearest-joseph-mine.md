"Joseph dearest, Joseph mine,<br/>
Help me cradle the child divine;<br/>
God reward thee and All that's thine<br/>
In paradise,"<br/>
So prays the mother Mary.<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
He came among us at Christmastide,<br/>
At Christmastide, in Bethlehem;<br/>
Men shall bring Him from far and wide<br/>
Love's diadem: Jesus, Jesus,<br/>
Lo, He comes, and loves, and saves, and frees us!<br/>
<br/>
"Gladly, dear one, lady mine,<br/>
Help I cradle this child of thine;<br/>
God's own light on us both shall shine<br/>
In paradise,<br/>
As prays the mother Mary."<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all that have goodwill!<br/>
God, who heaven and earth doth fill,<br/>
Comes to turn us away from ill,<br/>
And lies so still<br/>
Within the crib of Mary.<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
All shall come and bow the knee,<br/>
Wise and happy their souls shall be.<br/>
Loving such a divinity<br/>
As all may see<br/>
In Jesus, Son of Mary.<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Now is born Emmanual,<br/>
Prophesied once by Ezekiel,<br/>
Promised Mary by Gabriel,<br/>
Ah, who can tell<br/>
Thy praises, Son of Mary.<br/>
Chorus <br/>
<br/>
Thou my lazy heart hast stirred,<br/>
Thou, the Father’s eternal Word,<br/>
Greater than aught that ear has heard,<br/>
Thou tiny bird<br/>
Of love, thou Son of Mary.<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Sweet and lovely little one,<br/>
Thou princely, beautiful, God’s own Son,<br/>
Without thee all of us were undone;<br/>
Our love is Won<br/>
By thing, O Son of Mary.<br/>
Chorus<br/>
<br/>
Little man, and God indeed,<br/>
Little and poor, thou art all we need;<br/>
We will follow where thou dost lead,<br/>
And we will heed<br/>
Our brother, born of Mary.<br/>
Chorus<br/>
