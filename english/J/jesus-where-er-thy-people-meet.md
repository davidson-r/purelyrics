title: Jesus Whereer Thy People Meet

<center>
Jesus, where’er Thy people meet,<br/>
There they behold Thy mercy seat;<br/>
Where’er they seek Thee Thou art found,<br/>
And every place is hallowed ground.<br/>
<br/>
For Thou, within no walls confined,<br/>
Inhabitest the humble mind;<br/>
Such ever bring Thee, where they come,<br/>
And, going, take Thee to their home.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,<br/>
Thy former mercies here renew;<br/>
Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim<br/>
The sweetness of Thy saving Name.<br/>
<br/>
Here may we prove the power of prayer<br/>
To strengthen faith and sweeten care;<br/>
To teach our faint desires to rise,<br/>
And bring all Heav’n before our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Behold at Thy commanding word,<br/>
We stretch the curtain and the cord;<br/>
Come Thou, and fill this wider space,<br/>
And bless us with a large increase.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;<br/>
Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;<br/>
O rend the heavens, come quickly down,<br/>
And make a thousand hearts Thine own!
