Jesus a child His work begun:<br/>
How radiant dawned His heavenly day!<br/>
And those who such a race would run<br/>
As early should be on their way.<br/>
<br/>
His Father’s business was His care;<br/>
Yet in man’s favor still He grew;<br/>
O might we learn by thought and prayer,<br/>
Like Him a work of love to do!<br/>
<br/>
For all mankind He came, nor yet<br/>
An infant’s visit would deny;<br/>
Nor friend nor mother did forget<br/>
In His last hour of agony.<br/>
<br/>
O children, ask Him to impart<br/>
That spirit clear, that temper mild,<br/>
Which made the mother in her heart<br/>
Keep all the sayings of her Child.<br/>
<br/>
Bless Him Who said, of such as you<br/>
His Father’s kingdom is: and still,<br/>
His yoke to bear, His work to do,<br/>
Study His life to learn His will.
