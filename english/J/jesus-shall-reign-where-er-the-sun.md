<br/>
Jesus shall reign where’er the sun<br/>
Does his successive journeys run;<br/>
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,<br/>
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.<br/>
<br/>
Behold the islands with their kings,<br/>
And Europe her best tribute brings;<br/>
From north to south the princes meet,<br/>
To pay their homage at His feet.<br/>
<br/>
There Persia, glorious to behold,<br/>
There India shines in eastern gold;<br/>
And barb’rous nations at His word<br/>
Submit, and bow, and own their Lord.<br/>
<br/>
To Him shall endless prayer be made,<br/>
And praises throng to crown His head;<br/>
His Name like sweet perfume shall rise<br/>
With every morning sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
People and realms of every tongue<br/>
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;<br/>
And infant voices shall proclaim<br/>
Their early blessings on His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings abound wherever He reigns;<br/>
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;<br/>
The weary find eternal rest,<br/>
And all the sons of want are blessed.<br/>
<br/>
Where He displays His healing power,<br/>
Death and the curse are known no more:<br/>
In Him the tribes of Adam boast<br/>
More blessings than their father lost.<br/>
<br/>
Let every creature rise and bring<br/>
Peculiar honors to our King;<br/>
Angels descend with songs again,<br/>
And earth repeat the loud amen!<br/>
<br/>
Great God, whose universal sway<br/>
The known and unknown worlds obey,<br/>
Now give the kingdom to Thy Son,<br/>
Extend His power, exalt His throne.<br/>
<br/>
The scepter well becomes His hands;<br/>
All Heav’n submits to His commands;<br/>
His justice shall avenge the poor,<br/>
And pride and rage prevail no more.<br/>
<br/>
With power He vindicates the just,<br/>
And treads th’oppressor in the dust:<br/>
His worship and His fear shall last<br/>
Till hours, and years, and time be past.<br/>
<br/>
As rain on meadows newly mown,<br/>
So shall He send his influence down:<br/>
His grace on fainting souls distills,<br/>
Like heav’nly dew on thirsty hills.<br/>
<br/>
The heathen lands, that lie beneath<br/>
The shades of overspreading death,<br/>
Revive at His first dawning light;<br/>
And deserts blossom at the sight.<br/>
<br/>
The saints shall flourish in His days,<br/>
Dressed in the robes of joy and praise;<br/>
Peace, like a river, from His throne<br/>
Shall flow to nations yet unknown.<br/>
