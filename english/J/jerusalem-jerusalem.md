<br/>
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,<br/>
Thou city ever blest,<br/>
Within thy portals first I find<br/>
My safety, peace and rest.<br/>
Here dangers always threaten me,<br/>
My days in strife are spent,<br/>
And labor, sorrow, worry, grief,<br/>
I find at best their strength.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder, then, that I do long<br/>
O blessèd home, for thee,<br/>
Where I shall find a resting place,<br/>
From sin and sorrow free;<br/>
Where tears and weeping are no more,<br/>
Nor death, nor pain, nor night,<br/>
For former things are passed way,<br/>
And darkness turned to light.<br/>
<br/>
Now all for me has lost its charm<br/>
Which by the world is praised,<br/>
Since on the cross, through faith, I saw<br/>
My Savior Jesus raised;<br/>
My goal is fixed, one thing I ask,<br/>
Whate’er the cost may be,<br/>
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,<br/>
Soon to arrive in thee.<br/>
