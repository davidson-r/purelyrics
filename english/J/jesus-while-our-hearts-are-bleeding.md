title: Jesus While Our Hearts Are Bleeding

<br/>
Jesus, while our hearts are bleeding<br/>
O’er the spoils that death has won,<br/>
We would at this solemn meeting<br/>
Calmly say, “Thy will be done.”<br/>
<br/>
Though cast down, we’re not forsaken,<br/>
Though afflicted, not alone;<br/>
Thou didst give, and Thou hast taken;<br/>
Blessèd Lord, “Thy will be done.”<br/>
<br/>
Though today we’re filled with mourning,<br/>
Mercy still is on the throne;<br/>
With Thy smiles and love returning,<br/>
We can sing, “Thy will be done.”<br/>
<br/>
By Thy hands the boon was given;<br/>
Thou hast taken but Thine own;<br/>
Lord of earth, and God of Heaven,<br/>
Evermore, “Thy will be done.”<br/>
