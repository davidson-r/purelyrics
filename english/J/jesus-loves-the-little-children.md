<br/>
Jesus calls the children dear,<br/>
“Come to me and never fear,<br/>
For I love the little children of the world;<br/>
I will take you by the hand,<br/>
Lead you to the better land,<br/>
For I love the little children of the world.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves the little children,<br/>
All the children of the world.<br/>
Red and yellow, black and white,<br/>
All are precious in His sight,<br/>
Jesus loves the little children of the world.<br/>
<br/>
[Alternate refrain:<br/>
<br/>
Jesus died for all the children,<br/>
All the children of the world.<br/>
Red and yellow, black and white,<br/>
All are precious in His sight,<br/>
Jesus died for all the children of the world.]<br/>
<br/>
Jesus is the Shepherd true,<br/>
And He’ll always stand by you,<br/>
For He loves the little children of the world;<br/>
He’s a Savior great and strong,<br/>
And He’ll shield you from the wrong,<br/>
For He loves the little children of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I am coming, Lord, to Thee,<br/>
And Your soldier I will be,<br/>
For You love the little children of the world;<br/>
And Your cross I’ll always bear,<br/>
And for You I’ll do and dare,<br/>
For You love the little children of the world.<br/>
<br/>
