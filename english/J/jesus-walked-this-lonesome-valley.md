Jesus walked this lonesome valley.<br/>
He had to walk it by Himself;<br/>
O, nobody else could walk it for Him,<br/>
He had to walk it by Himself.<br/>
<br/>
We must walk this lonesome valley,<br/>
We have to walk it by ourselves;<br/>
O, nobody else can walk it for us,<br/>
We have to walk it by ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
You must go and stand your trial,<br/>
You have to stand it by yourself,<br/>
O, nobody else can stand it for you,<br/>
You have to stand it by yourself.
