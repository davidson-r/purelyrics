<br/>
I hear the Savior say,<br/>
“Thy strength indeed is small;<br/>
Child of weakness, watch and pray,<br/>
Find in Me thine all in all.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus paid it all,<br/>
All to Him I owe;<br/>
Sin had left a crimson stain,<br/>
He washed it white as snow.<br/>
<br/>
For nothing good have I<br/>
Whereby Thy grace to claim,<br/>
I’ll wash my garments white<br/>
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And now complete in Him<br/>
My robe His righteousness,<br/>
Close sheltered ’neath His side,<br/>
I am divinely blest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lord, now indeed I find<br/>
Thy power and Thine alone,<br/>
Can change the leper’s spots<br/>
And melt the heart of stone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When from my dying bed<br/>
My ransomed soul shall rise,<br/>
“Jesus died my soul to save,”<br/>
Shall rend the vaulted skies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And when before the throne<br/>
I stand in Him complete,<br/>
I’ll lay my trophies down<br/>
All down at Jesus’ feet.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
