<br/>
In the Bible we are told<br/>
Of a prophet who was called<br/>
To a city that was steeped in awful sin;<br/>
All the people in that place<br/>
Were devoid of saving grace,<br/>
And the prophet seemed afraid to enter in.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Over there, over there,<br/>
In that land bright and fair,<br/>
Oh, he’ll tell me all about it over there;<br/>
On the hallelujah strand<br/>
I’ll take Jonah by the hand,<br/>
And he’ll tell me all about it over there.<br/>
<br/>
Then this prophet forth was sent<br/>
That old Nineveh might repent,<br/>
But instead of that to Tarshish he set sail;<br/>
Oh! the winds began to blow,<br/>
Overboard did Jonah go,<br/>
And he found a mercy seat inside the whale.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In the cold and briny deep<br/>
Tears of grief did Jonah weep,<br/>
And the big fish threw him out upon the shore;<br/>
Then he gladly went his way,<br/>
Preached to Nineveh night and day,<br/>
And he did not care to backslide any more.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, some people don’t believe<br/>
That a whale could him receive.<br/>
But that does not make my song at all untrue;<br/>
There are whales on every side,<br/>
With their big mouths open wide—<br/>
Just take care, my friend, or one will swallow you.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Many souls are tossed about<br/>
By the whales of fear and doubt,<br/>
But the Savior wants to take them by the hand.<br/>
If they will His voice obey,<br/>
He will save them right away,<br/>
And will guide them safely to the promised land.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
