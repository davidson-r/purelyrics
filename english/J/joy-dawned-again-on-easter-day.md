<br/>
Joy dawned again on Easter Day,<br/>
The sun shone out with fairer ray,<br/>
When, to their longing eyes restored<br/>
Thâ€™Apostles saw their risen Lord.<br/>
<br/>
His risen flesh with radiance glowed;<br/>
His wounded hands and feet He showed:<br/>
Those scars their silent witness gave<br/>
That Christ was risen from the grave.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, King of gentleness,<br/>
Do Thou our inmost hearts possess;<br/>
And we to Thee will ever raise<br/>
The tribute of our grateful praise.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Who art the Lord of all,<br/>
In this our Easter festival<br/>
From every weapon death can wield<br/>
Thine own redeemed, Thy people, shield.<br/>
<br/>
All praise, O risen Lord, we give<br/>
To Thee, Who dead, again dost live;<br/>
To God the Father equal praise,<br/>
And God the Holy Ghost, we raise.<br/>
