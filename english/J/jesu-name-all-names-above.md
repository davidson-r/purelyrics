<br/>
Jesu! Name all names above,<br/>
Jesu, best and dearest,<br/>
Jesu, fount of perfect love,<br/>
Holiest, tenderest, nearest;<br/>
Jesu, source of grace completest,<br/>
Jesu purest, Jesu sweetest,<br/>
Jesu well of power divine,<br/>
Make me, keep me, seal me Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, open me the gate,<br/>
That the robber entered,<br/>
Who in that most lost estate<br/>
Wholly on Thee ventured.<br/>
Thou Whose wounds are ever pleading,<br/>
And Thy passion interceding,<br/>
From my misery let me rise<br/>
To a home in paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, crowned with thorns for me,<br/>
Scourged for my transgression,<br/>
Witnessing through agony,<br/>
That Thy good confession;<br/>
Jesu, clad in purple raiment,<br/>
For my evil making payment,<br/>
Let not all Thy woe and pain,<br/>
Let not Calv’ry be in vain.<br/>
<br/>
When I reach death’s bitter sea,<br/>
And its waves mount higher,<br/>
Earthly help forsaking me<br/>
As the storm draws nigher,<br/>
Jesu, leave me not to languish<br/>
Helpless, homeless, full of anguish;<br/>
Jesu, let me hear Thee say,<br/>
“Thou shalt be with Me today.”<br/>
