<br/>
Jesus, grant that balm and healing<br/>
In Thy holy wounds I find,<br/>
Every hour that I am feeling,<br/>
Pains of body and of mind.<br/>
Should some evil thought within<br/>
Tempt my treacherous heart to sin,<br/>
Show the peril, and from sinning<br/>
Keep me ere its first beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Should some lust or sharp temptation<br/>
Prove too strong for flesh and blood,<br/>
Let me think upon Thy Passion,<br/>
And the breach is soon made good.<br/>
Or should Satan press me hard,<br/>
Let me then be on my guard,<br/>
Saying, “Christ for me was wounded,”<br/>
That the tempter flee confounded.<br/>
<br/>
If the world my heart entices<br/>
On the broad and easy road<br/>
With its mirth and luring vices,<br/>
Let me think upon the load<br/>
Thou didst carry and endure<br/>
That I flee all thoughts impure,<br/>
Banishing each wild emotion,<br/>
Calm and blest in my devotion.<br/>
<br/>
Every wound that pains or grieves me,<br/>
By Thy stripes, Lord, is made whole;<br/>
When I’m faint, Thy cross revives me,<br/>
Granting new life to my soul.<br/>
Yea, Thy comfort renders sweet<br/>
Every bitter cup I meet;<br/>
For Thy all atoning Passion<br/>
Has procured my soul’s salvation.<br/>
<br/>
O my God, my Rock and Tower,<br/>
Grant that in Thy death I trust,<br/>
Knowing death has lost his power<br/>
Since Thou trodd’st him in the dust.<br/>
Savior, let Thine agony<br/>
Ever help and comfort me;<br/>
When I die, be my Protection,<br/>
Light and Life and Resurrection.<br/>
