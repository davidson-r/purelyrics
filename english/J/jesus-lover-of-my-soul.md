<br/>
Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly,<br/>
While the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high.<br/>
Hide me, O my Savior, hide, till the storm of life is past;<br/>
Safe into the haven guide; O receive my soul at last.<br/>
<br/>
Other refuge have I none, hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br/>
Leave, ah! leave me not alone, still support and comfort me.<br/>
All my trust on Thee is stayed, all my help from Thee I bring;<br/>
Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.<br/>
<br/>
Wilt Thou not regard my call? Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?<br/>
Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall - Lo! on Thee I cast my care;<br/>
Reach me out Thy gracious hand! While I of Thy strength receive,<br/>
Hoping against hope I stand, dying, and behold, I live.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in Thee I find;<br/>
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind.<br/>
Just and holy is Thy Name, I am all unrighteousness;<br/>
False and full of sin I am; Thou art full of truth and grace.<br/>
<br/>
Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin;<br/>
Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.<br/>
Thou of life the fountain art, freely let me take of Thee;<br/>
Spring Thou up within my heart; rise to all eternity.<br/>
