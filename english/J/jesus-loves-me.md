Jesus loves me! This I know,<br/>
For the Bible tells me so.<br/>
Little ones to Him belong;<br/>
They are weak, but He is strong.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Jesus loves me!<br/>
Yes, Jesus loves me!<br/>
Yes, Jesus loves me!<br/>
The Bible tells me so.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves me! This I know,<br/>
As He loved so long ago,<br/>
Taking children on His knee,<br/>
Saying, “Let them come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves me still today,<br/>
Walking with me on my way,<br/>
Wanting as a friend to give<br/>
Light and love to all who live.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves me! He who died<br/>
Heaven’s gate to open wide;<br/>
He will wash away my sin,<br/>
Let His little child come in.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves me! He will stay<br/>
Close beside me all the way;<br/>
Thou hast bled and died for me,<br/>
I will henceforth live for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
