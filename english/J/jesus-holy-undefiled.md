Jesus, holy, undefiled,<br/>
Listen to a little child;<br/>
Thou hast sent the glorious light,<br/>
Chasing far the silent night.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast sent the sun to shine,<br/>
O’er this glorious world of Thine;<br/>
Warmth to give and pleasant glow,<br/>
On each tender flow’r below.<br/>
<br/>
Now the little birds arise,<br/>
Chirping gaily in the skies;<br/>
Thee their tiny voices praise,<br/>
In the early songs they raise.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, by Whom the birds are fed,<br/>
Give to me my daily bread;<br/>
And Thy holy Spirit give,<br/>
Without Whom I cannot live.
