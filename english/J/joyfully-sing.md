<center>
<br/>
Sing with a tuneful song, sing and adore<br/>
Jesus the Holy One, King evermore;<br/>
He is the desert Rock, there we may hide,<br/>
Under His mighty shade safe we abide.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Joyfully sing, joyfully sing,<br/>
Joyfully sing, joyfully sing,<br/>
Joyfully sing, joyfully sing,<br/>
Light of eternity,<br/>
Honor and praise to Thee,<br/>
Now and forever be,<br/>
Jesus our King.<br/>
<br/>
Sing with a grateful heart, hallow His Name,<br/>
All He has done for us, gladly proclaim;<br/>
Tell how each promise sweet cheers us along,<br/>
Praise we the Lord of lords, Fountain of song.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sing with a trusting heart, looking away<br/>
Up to the brighter land, brighter than day;<br/>
Sing with a glowing heart filled with His love,<br/>
Sing till our happy souls anchor above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
