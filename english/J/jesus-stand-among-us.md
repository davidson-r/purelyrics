title: Jesus Stand Among Us

<center>
<br/>
Jesus, stand among us<br/>
In Thy risen power,<br/>
Let this time of worship<br/>
Be a hallowed hour.<br/>
<br/>
BreaThe Holy Spirit<br/>
Into every heart,<br/>
Bid the fears and sorrows<br/>
From each soul depart.<br/>
<br/>
Thus with quickened footsteps<br/>
We'll pursue our way,<br/>
Watching for the dawning<br/>
Of the eternal day.<br/>

</center>
