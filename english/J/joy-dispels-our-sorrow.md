title: Joy Dispels Our Sorrow

<center>
Morning light was dawning o’er the distant hills,<br/>
Banished was the midnight gloom;<br/>
Silently the angels clad in bright array<br/>
Came to guard the dear Redeemer’s tomb.<br/>
Soldiers were affrighted and in terror fled,<br/>
While the angels roll the stone away.<br/>
Then with joy proclaiming, “Christ the Lord is ris’n”<br/>
“See the place where once the Savior lay.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Joy dispels our sorrow—pleasures banish pain—<br/>
Earth awakes from winter’s gloom;<br/>
Easter anthems ringing tell the joyful news<br/>
“Christ is risen from the tomb.”<br/>
<br/>
Loving ones who sought Him at the break of day,<br/>
Found the angels waiting there;<br/>
Joy dispelled their sorrow—fear gave way to faith—<br/>
Hope succeeded all their deep despair.<br/>
For the angels told them, “Jesus is not here,”<br/>
“But had surely risen as He said.”<br/>
Then with eager footsteps joyfully they tell<br/>
How that Christ had risen from the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Easter tells its gladness all the year around—<br/>
Happy birds their tribute bring;<br/>
Fragrant flowers blooming after winter days<br/>
Speak to us the joys of coming spring.<br/>
Earthly pleasures vanish, flowers soon shall fade,<br/>
But the joy of Easter shall endure.<br/>
Hope of resurrection never shall grow dim<br/>
While the Word of God abideth sure.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
