title: Jesus Joy of Our Desiring

<center>
Jesus, joy of man’s desiring,<br/>
Holy wisdom, love most bright;<br/>
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring<br/>
Soar to uncreated light.<br/>
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned,<br/>
With the fire of life impassioned,<br/>
Striving still to truth unknown,<br/>
Soaring, dying round Thy throne.<br/>
<br/>
Through the way where hope is guiding,<br/>
Hark, what peaceful music rings;<br/>
Where the flock, in Thee confiding,<br/>
Drink of joy from deathless springs.<br/>
Theirs is beauty’s fairest pleasure;<br/>
Theirs is wisdom’s holiest treasure.<br/>
Thou dost ever lead Thine own<br/>
In the love of joys unknown.
