<br/>
Joy fills our inmost hearts today!<br/>
The royal Child is born:<br/>
And angel hosts in glad array<br/>
His advent keep this morn.<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice! Th’incarnate Word<br/>
Has come on earth to dwell;<br/>
No sweeter sound than this is heard<br/>
Emmanuel!<br/>
<br/>
Low at the cradle throne we bend,<br/>
We wonder and adore;<br/>
And feel no bliss can ours transcend,<br/>
No joy was sweet before.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For us the world must lose its charms<br/>
Before the manger shrine,<br/>
When, folded in Thy mother’s arms,<br/>
We see Thee, Babe divine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou Light of uncreated Light,<br/>
Shine on us, holy Child;<br/>
That we may keep Thy birthday bright,<br/>
With service undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
