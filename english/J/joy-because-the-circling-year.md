<br/>
Joy! because the circling year<br/>
Brings our day of blessings here;<br/>
Day when first the light divine<br/>
On the Church began to shine.<br/>
<br/>
Like to quivering tongues of flame<br/>
Unto each the Spirit came,<br/>
Tongues, that earth might hear their call,<br/>
Fire, that love might burn in all.<br/>
<br/>
So the wondrous works of God<br/>
Wondrously were spread abroad;<br/>
Every tribe’s familiar tone<br/>
Made the glorious marvel known.<br/>
<br/>
Hardened scoffers vainly jeered;<br/>
Listening strangers heard and feared,<br/>
Knew the prophets’ word fulfilled,<br/>
Owned the work which God had willed.<br/>
<br/>
Still Thy Spirit’s fullness, Lord,<br/>
On Thy waiting Church be poured;<br/>
Grant our burdened hearts release;<br/>
Grant us Thine abiding peace.<br/>
