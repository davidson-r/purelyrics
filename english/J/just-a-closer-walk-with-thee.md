title: Just A Closer Walk With Thee

<center>
I am weak, but Thou art strong;<br/>
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;<br/>
I’ll be satisfied as long<br/>
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Just a closer walk with Thee,<br/>
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,<br/>
Daily walking close to Thee,<br/>
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.<br/>
<br/>
Through this world of toil and snares,<br/>
If I falter, Lord, who cares?<br/>
Who with me my burden shares?<br/>
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When my feeble life is o’er,<br/>
Time for me will be no more;<br/>
Guide me gently, safely o’er<br/>
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
