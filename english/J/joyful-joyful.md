<br/>
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love;<br/>
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, opening to the sun above.<br/>
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away;<br/>
Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!<br/>
<br/>
All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,<br/>
Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken praise.<br/>
Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, flashing sea,<br/>
Singing bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed,<br/>
Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest!<br/>
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother, all who live in love are Thine;<br/>
Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.<br/>
<br/>
Mortals, join the happy chorus, which the morning stars began;<br/>
Father love is reigning oâ€™er us, brother love binds man to man.<br/>
Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife,<br/>
Joyful music leads us Sunward in the triumph song of life.<br/>
