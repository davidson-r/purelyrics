title: Jesus Bids Us Shine

<center>
<br/>
Jesus bids us shine<br/>
With a pure, clear light,<br/>
Like a little candle<br/>
Burning in the night.<br/>
In this world of darkness<br/>
So let us shine<br/>
You in your small corner,<br/>
And I in mine.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus bids us shine,<br/>
First of all for Him;<br/>
Well He sees and knows it,<br/>
If our light grows dim.<br/>
He looks down from Heaven<br/>
To see us shine<br/>
You in your small corner,<br/>
And I in mine.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus bids us shine,<br/>
Then, for all around;<br/>
Many kinds of darkness<br/>
In the world are found<br/>
Sin and want and sorrow;<br/>
So we must shine<br/>
You in your small corner,<br/>
And I in mine.<br/>
