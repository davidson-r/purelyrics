Jesu, Dulcis Memoria<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, the very thought of Thee<br/>
With sweetness fills the breast! <br/>
Yet sweeter far Thy face to see<br/>
And in Thy Presence rest.<br/>
<br/>
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,<br/>
Nor can the memory find,<br/>
A sweeter sound than Jesus' Name,<br/>
The Savior of mankind.<br/>
<br/>
O hope of every contrite heart!<br/>
O joy of all the meek!<br/>
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!<br/>
How good to those who seek!<br/>
<br/>
But what to those who find? Ah! this<br/>
Nor tongue nor pen can show<br/>
The love of Jesus, what it is,<br/>
None but His loved ones know.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus! our only hope be Thou,<br/>
As Thou our prize shalt be; <br/>
In Thee be all our glory now,<br/>
And through eternity. Amen.
