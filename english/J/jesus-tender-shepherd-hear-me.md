<br/>
Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me;<br/>
Bless Thy little lamb tonight;<br/>
Through the darkness be Thou near me;<br/>
Watch my sleep till morning light.<br/>
<br/>
All this day thy hand has led me,<br/>
And I thank Thee for Thy care;<br/>
Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,<br/>
Listen to my evening prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Let my sins be all forgiven;<br/>
Bless the friends I love so well;<br/>
Take me, when I die, to Heaven,<br/>
Happy there with Thee to dwell.<br/>

</center>
