<br/>
Jehovah is my Light,<br/>
And my Salvation near;<br/>
Who shall my soul affright,<br/>
Or cause my heart to fear?<br/>
While God my strength, my life sustains,<br/>
Secure from fear my soul remains.<br/>
<br/>
When evildoers came<br/>
To make my life their prey,<br/>
They stumbled in their shame<br/>
And fell in sore dismay;<br/>
Though hosts make war on every side,<br/>
Still fearless I in God confide.<br/>
<br/>
My one request has been,<br/>
And still this prayer I raise,<br/>
That I may dwell within<br/>
God’s house through all my days,<br/>
Jehovah’s beauty to admire,<br/>
And in His temple to inquire.<br/>
<br/>
When troubles round me swell,<br/>
When fears and dangers throng,<br/>
Securely I will dwell<br/>
In His pavilion strong;<br/>
Within the covert of His tent<br/>
He hides me till the storm is spent.<br/>
<br/>
Uplifted on a rock<br/>
Above my foes around,<br/>
Amid the battle shock<br/>
My song shall still resound;<br/>
Then joyful offerings I will bring<br/>
Jehovah’s praise my heart shall sing.<br/>
