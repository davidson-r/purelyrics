title: Jerusalem

<br/>
And did those feet in ancient time<br/>
Walk upon England's mountain green?<br/>
And was the holy Lamb of God<br/>
On England's pleasant pastures seen?<br/>
And did the countenance divine<br/>
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br/>
And was Jerusalem builded here<br/>
Among those dark satanic mills?<br/>
<br/>
Bring me my bow of burning gold!<br/>
Bring me my arrows of desire!<br/>
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!<br/>
Bring me my chariot of fire!<br/>
I will not cease from mental fight,<br/>
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br/>
Till we have built Jerusalem<br/>
In England's green and pleasant land.<br/>
