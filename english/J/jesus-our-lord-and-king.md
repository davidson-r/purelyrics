<center>
Jesus, our Lord and King,<br/>
To You our praises rise;<br/>
To You our bodies we present,<br/>
A living sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Now justified by grace,<br/>
And made alive to God,<br/>
Formed for Yourself to show Your praise,<br/>
We sound Your love abroad.<br/>
<br/>
As dead indeed to sin,<br/>
We rise to walk anew,<br/>
Henceforth, as not our own, but Yours,<br/>
We follow only You.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized into Your death,<br/>
With You again we rise,<br/>
To newness of a life of faith,<br/>
To new and endless joys.
