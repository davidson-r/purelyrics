<br/>
Just a little sunshine everywhere we go,<br/>
Over darkened pathways, rays of blessing throw;<br/>
Golden rays of gladness from a loving heart<br/>
Help the world to brighten; let us do our part.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sunshine, sunshine, just a little sunshine,<br/>
Bearing heav’nly gladness through this world below;<br/>
Sunshine, sunshine, just a little sunshine,<br/>
Telling love’s sweet story, everywhere we go.<br/>
<br/>
Like the blessèd Master, in this life are we<br/>
Sent to comfort others, publish liberty;<br/>
Willing hands outreaching, strengthening the weak,<br/>
In the name of Jesus, consolation speak.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Just a little sunshine makes the roses grow;<br/>
In the barren places, flowers begin to show;<br/>
Lift the clouds of sorrow, cheer the hour of gloom,<br/>
Fruits of grace will ripen for immortal bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
