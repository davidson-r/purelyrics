<br/>
Jerusalem, lift up thy voice!<br/>
Daughter of Zion, now rejoice!<br/>
Thy King is come, Whose mighty hand<br/>
Henceforth shall reign o’er every land.<br/>
<br/>
He comes to every tribe and race,<br/>
A Messenger of truth and grace:<br/>
With peace He comes from Heaven above<br/>
On earth to found His realm of love.<br/>
<br/>
In God’s eternal covenant,<br/>
He comes for our salvation sent.<br/>
The star of hope moves on before,<br/>
And hosts assemble to adore.<br/>
<br/>
Let all the world with one accord<br/>
Now hail the coming of the Lord:<br/>
Praise to the Prince of heavenly birth<br/>
Who bringeth peace to all the earth.<br/>
