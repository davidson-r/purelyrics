Teacher<br/>
<br/>
Little eyes, looking wise,<br/>
Have you said your morning prayer?<br/>
Have you thought, as you ought,<br/>
Of our heavenly Father’s care?<br/>
Tell me what our prayer should be<br/>
When the morning light we see.<br/>
<br/>
All<br/>
<br/>
Pleasant light, clear and bright,<br/>
Shining on the world today.<br/>
So may love from above<br/>
Shine along our upward way;<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
All<br/>
<br/>
Water clear, standing near,<br/>
Wash our hands and faces clean.<br/>
May the Lord, by His Word,<br/>
Wash our hearts from every sin.<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Girls<br/>
<br/>
Cloak and hood, new and good,<br/>
Made to keep our bodies warm.<br/>
Words of truth, learned in youth,<br/>
Keep our souls from every harm.<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Boys<br/>
<br/>
Boot or shoe, old or new,<br/>
Let us keep them clean and neat;<br/>
Let us pray that we may<br/>
Some day walk the golden street;<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Girls<br/>
<br/>
Collar white, ribbons bright,<br/>
Apron, bonnet, shawl or dress;<br/>
So may we ever be<br/>
Clad in Jesus’ righteousness;<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Boys<br/>
<br/>
Top or ball, treasures all,<br/>
Books and toys I dearly prize;<br/>
Yet may I, when I die,<br/>
To my heavenly treasures rise;<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
All<br/>
<br/>
Night or day, work or play,<br/>
In our hearts may be a prayer;<br/>
God can see if there be,<br/>
Well He knows what thoughts are there;<br/>
So let everything we see<br/>
Turn our thoughts, O Lord, to Thee.<br/>
