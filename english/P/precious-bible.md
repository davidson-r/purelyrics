Precious Bible! what a treasure<br/>
Does the Word of God afford?<br/>
All I want for life or pleasure,<br/>
Food and med’cine, shield and sword:<br/>
Let the world account me poor,<br/>
Having this I need no more.<br/>
<br/>
Food to which the world’s a stranger,<br/>
Here my hungry soul enjoys;<br/>
Of excess there is no danger,<br/>
Though it fills, it never cloys:<br/>
On a dying Christ I feed,<br/>
He is meat and drink indeed.<br/>
<br/>
When my faith is faint and sickly,<br/>
Or when Satan wounds my mind,<br/>
Cordials, to revive me quickly,<br/>
Healing med’cines here I find:<br/>
To the promises I flee,<br/>
Each affords a remedy.<br/>
<br/>
In the hour of dark temptation<br/>
Satan cannot make me yield;<br/>
For the Word of consolation<br/>
Is to me a mighty shield<br/>
While the scripture truths are sure,<br/>
From his malice I’m secure.<br/>
<br/>
Vain his threats to overcome me,<br/>
When I take the Spirits’ sword;<br/>
Then with ease I drive him from me.<br/>
Satan trembles at the word:<br/>
’Tis a sword for conquest made,<br/>
Keen the edge, and strong the blade.<br/>
<br/>
Shall I envy then the miser<br/>
Doting on his golden store?<br/>
Sure I am, or should be, wiser,<br/>
I am rich, ’tis he is poor:<br/>
Jesus gives me in his word,<br/>
Food and med’cine, shield and sword.<br/>
