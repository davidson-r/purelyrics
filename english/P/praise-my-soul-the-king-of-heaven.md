<br/>
Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,<br/>
To his feet thy tribute bring;<br/>
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>
Who like me his praise should sing?<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Praise the everlasting King.<br/>
<br/>
Praise him for his grace and favour<br/>
To our fathers in distress;<br/>
Praise him still the same as ever,<br/>
Slow to chide, and swift to bless:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Glorious in his faithfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Father-like, he tends and spares us,<br/>
Well our feeble frame he knows;<br/>
In his hands he gently bears us,<br/>
Rescues us from all our foes:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Widely as his mercy flows.<br/>
<br/>
Angels, help us to adore him;<br/>
Ye behold him face to face;<br/>
Sun and moon, bow down before him,<br/>
Dwellers all in time and space:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Praise with us the God of grace.<br/>
