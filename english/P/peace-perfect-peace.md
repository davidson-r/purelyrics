<center>
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?<br/>
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?<br/>
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, perfect peace, with sorrow surging round?<br/>
In Jesus's presence nought but calm is found.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?<br/>
In Jesus's keeping we are safe, and they.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?<br/>
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?<br/>
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers<br/>
<br/>
It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,<br/>
and Jesus call us to heaven's perfect peace.
