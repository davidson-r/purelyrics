<br/>
Praise the Savior now and ever;<br/>
Praise Him, all beneath the skies;<br/>
Prostrate lying, suff’ring, dying<br/>
On the cross, a sacrifice.<br/>
Vict’ry gaining, life obtaining,<br/>
Now in glory He doth rise.<br/>
<br/>
Man’s work faileth, Christ’s availeth;<br/>
He is all our righteousness;<br/>
He, our Savior, has forever<br/>
Set us free from dire distress.<br/>
Through His merit we inherit<br/>
Light and peace and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Sin’s bonds severed, we’re delivered,<br/>
Christ has bruised the serpent’s head;<br/>
Death no longer is the stronger,<br/>
Hell itself is captive led.<br/>
Christ has risen from death’s prison,<br/>
O’er the tomb He light has shed.<br/>
<br/>
For His favor, praise forever,<br/>
Unto God the Father sing;<br/>
Praise the Savior, praise Him ever,<br/>
Son of God, our Lord and King.<br/>
Praise the Spirit, through Christ’s merit,<br/>
He doth us salvation bring.<br/>
