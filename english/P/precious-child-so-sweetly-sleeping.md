<br/>
Precious Child, so sweetly sleeping<br/>
In a virgin’s fond embrace;<br/>
Heav’nly hosts their watch are keeping<br/>
O’er Thy humble dwelling place;<br/>
Blest Messiah, newborn King,<br/>
Let my heart its tribute bring.<br/>
<br/>
Anthems joyous now are ringing<br/>
In the skies of Bethlehem;<br/>
Angels their sweet song are singing,<br/>
“Peace on earth, good will to men.”<br/>
Precious Jesus, at Thy birth<br/>
Heaven’s peace is brought to earth.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetly rest, Thou promised Savior,<br/>
By the prophets long foretold;<br/>
Brightly beams the Father’s favor,<br/>
Now all men His love behold.<br/>
Virgin born Immanuel,<br/>
Let my tongue Thy praises tell!<br/>
<br/>
Promised Savior, I adore Thee,<br/>
Son of David, Son of God!<br/>
What can mortals bring before Thee?<br/>
All is Thine on earthly sod.<br/>
Take my heart and let it be<br/>
Filled with love, dear Child, to Thee.<br/>
