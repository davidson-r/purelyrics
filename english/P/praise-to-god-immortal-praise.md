<br/>
Praise to God, immortal praise,<br/>
For the love that crowns our days;<br/>
Bounteous Source of every joy,<br/>
Let Thy praise our tongues employ.<br/>
<br/>
Flocks that whiten all the plain;<br/>
Yellow sheaves of ripened grain;<br/>
Clouds that drop their fattening dews,<br/>
Suns that temperate warmth diffuse.<br/>
<br/>
All that Spring with bounteous hand<br/>
Scatters o’er the smiling land;<br/>
All that liberal Autumn pours<br/>
From her rich o’erflowing stores.<br/>
<br/>
These to Thee, my God, we owe,<br/>
Source whence all our blessings flow;<br/>
And for these my soul shall raise<br/>
Grateful vows and solemn praise.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, should rising whirlwinds tear<br/>
From its stem the ripening ear;<br/>
Should the fig tree’s blasted shoot<br/>
Drop her green untimely fruit,<br/>
<br/>
Should the vine put forth no more,<br/>
Nor the olive yield her store;<br/>
Though the sickening flocks should fall,<br/>
And the herds desert the stall,<br/>
<br/>
Yet to Thee my soul shall raise<br/>
Grateful vows and solemn praise;<br/>
And, when every blessing’s flown<br/>
Love Thee for Thyself alone.<br/>
