Praise to the Lord, the almighty, the King of creations;<br/>
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation:<br/>
All ye who hear,<br/>
Now to his temple draw near,<br/>
Joining in glad adoration.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,<br/>
Shieldeth thee gently from harm, or when fainting sustaineth:<br/>
Hast thou not seen<br/>
How thy heart's wishes have been<br/>
Granted in what he ordaineth?<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;<br/>
Surely his goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee:<br/>
Ponder anew<br/>
What the Almighty can do,<br/>
If to the end he befriend thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!<br/>
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before him!<br/>
Let the Amen<br/>
Sound from his people again:<br/>
Gladly for ay we adore him.
