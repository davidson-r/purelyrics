<br/>
Pour out Thy Spirit from on high;<br/>
Lord, Thine assembled servants bless;<br/>
Graces and gifts to each supply,<br/>
And clothe Thy priests with righteousness.<br/>
<br/>
Within Thy temple when they stand,<br/>
To teach the truth, as taught by Thee,<br/>
Savior, like stars in Thy right hand<br/>
May all Thy Churchâ€™s pastors be.<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom and zeal and faith impart,<br/>
Firmness with meekness, from above,<br/>
To bear Thy people in their heart,<br/>
And love the souls whom Thou dost love:<br/>
<br/>
To watch and pray and never faint,<br/>
By day and night, strict guard to keep,<br/>
To warn the sinner, cheer the saint,<br/>
Nourish Thy lambs, and feed Thy sheep.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when their work is finished here,<br/>
May they in hope their charge resign;<br/>
When the Chief Shepherd shall appear,<br/>
O God, may they and we be Thine.<br/>
