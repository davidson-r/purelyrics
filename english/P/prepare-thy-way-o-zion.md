<br/>
Prepare the way, O Zion!<br/>
Ye awful deeps, rise high;<br/>
Sink low, ye towering mountains,<br/>
The Lord is drawing nigh;<br/>
The righteous King of glory,<br/>
Foretold in sacred story.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O blest is He that came<br/>
In God the Father’s Name.<br/>
<br/>
O Zion, He approacheth,<br/>
Thy Lord and King for aye!<br/>
Strew palms where He advanceth,<br/>
Spread garments in His way.<br/>
God’s promise faileth never,<br/>
Hosanna sound forever!<br/>
<br/>
Fling wide thy portals, Zion<br/>
And hail thy glorious King;<br/>
His tidings of salvation<br/>
To every people bring,<br/>
Who, waiting yet in sadness,<br/>
Would sing His praise in gladness.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He cometh not with warriors,<br/>
And not with pomp and show,<br/>
Yet smiteth He with terror<br/>
Sin, death, and every foe.<br/>
The Spirit’s sword He wieldeth,<br/>
Not e’en to death He yieldeth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Give heed, thou sinful people,<br/>
Thy King and Savior own;<br/>
The kingdom He hath founded<br/>
Is not an earthly one;<br/>
No power can overthrow it,<br/>
Nor earthly wisdom know it.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The throne which He ascendeth<br/>
Is fixed in heaven above:<br/>
His sanctified dominion<br/>
Is light alone and love.<br/>
His praise be ever sounding<br/>
For grace and peace abounding.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jerusalem is fallen,<br/>
And closed its temple door;<br/>
Its sacrifices ended;<br/>
Its scepter is no more.<br/>
Christ’s kingdom never ceaseth,<br/>
Its glory still increaseth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
