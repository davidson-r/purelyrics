<br/>
Here feast I at my Father’s board<br/>
Who starved among the swine;<br/>
For me must every foot be fleet<br/>
And every lamp must shine;<br/>
For me the merry music sounds,<br/>
The dancers dip and twine.<br/>
<br/>
My heart beats fast against my robe,<br/>
The best robe, soft and red;<br/>
With sobbing breath and tightening throat<br/>
And tears in rapture shed,<br/>
I feel His ring upon my hand,<br/>
His blessings on my head.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, bitter was the way, and oft<br/>
My blood my path would trace;<br/>
And guilt and grief and stabbing shame<br/>
With all my steps kept pace;<br/>
And yet I famished not for bread<br/>
So sore as for His face.<br/>
<br/>
The road seemed endless. On I fared,<br/>
Wresting each mile from death;<br/>
Then such an awe upon me fell<br/>
I scarce could draw my breath;<br/>
My spirit felt His coming as<br/>
Of one that succoreth.<br/>
<br/>
Blind, fainting, to His mighty breast<br/>
He caught and held me fast;<br/>
I knew the fortress of His arms<br/>
About my weakness cast;<br/>
And, when He kissed my traitor cheek,<br/>
I guessed His heart at last.<br/>
<br/>
The piteous words I oft had conned<br/>
I trembling strove to say;<br/>
But sudden glory round me poured<br/>
A brighter, richer day.<br/>
In wonderment I lifted up<br/>
My head that drooping lay.<br/>
<br/>
The glory streamed from out His eyes,<br/>
As from all Beauty’s throne.<br/>
O depths of love unthinkable<br/>
That in that splendor shone!<br/>
O pain of love that travaileth<br/>
And bleedeth for its own.<br/>
<br/>
O gleam of wisdom hoar with eld<br/>
Ere sang the stars of morn!<br/>
O shifting, blending, dazzling lights<br/>
That thrilled my hope forlorn<br/>
To undreamed miracles of joy<br/>
And surge of life reborn!<br/>
<br/>
He brought me home, and here I sit,<br/>
Even in my boyhood’s place;<br/>
And on my very soul is stamped<br/>
Each largess of His grace;<br/>
But still transfiguring all I see<br/>
That radiance of His face!<br/>
