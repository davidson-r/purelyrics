<br/>
Praise, O praise our God and King;<br/>
Hymns of adoration sing;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him that He made the sun<br/>
Day by day his course to run;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
And the silver moon by night,<br/>
Shining with her gentle light;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him that He gave the rain<br/>
To mature the swelling grain;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
And hath bid the fruitful field<br/>
Crops of precious increase yield;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
Praise Him for our harvest store,<br/>
He hath filled the garner floor;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
And for richer food than this,<br/>
Pledge of everlasting bliss;<br/>
For His mercies still endure<br/>
Ever faithful, ever sure.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to our bounteous King;<br/>
Glory let creation sing;<br/>
Glory to the Father, Son,<br/>
And blest Spirit, Three in One.<br/>
