<br/>
Praise the Saviour, all ye nations,<br/>
Praise Him, all ye hosts above;<br/>
Shout, with joyful acclamation,<br/>
His divine, victorious love;<br/>
Be His kingdom now promoted,<br/>
Let the earth her Monarch know;<br/>
Be my all to Him devoted,<br/>
To my Lord my all I owe.<br/>
<br/>
See how beauteous on the mountains<br/>
Are their feet, whose grand design<br/>
Is to guide us to the fountains<br/>
That o’erflow with bliss divine,<br/>
Who proclaim the joyful tidings<br/>
Of salvation all around,<br/>
Disregard the world’s deridings,<br/>
And in works of love abound.<br/>
<br/>
With my substance will I honor<br/>
My Redeemer and my Lord;<br/>
Were ten thousand worlds my manor,<br/>
All were nothing to His Word:<br/>
While the heralds of salvation<br/>
His abounding grace proclaim,<br/>
Let His friends, of every station,<br/>
Gladly join to spread His fame.<br/>
