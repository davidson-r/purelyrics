<br/>
How sweet the word of Christ the Lord,<br/>
While on the cross He dies,<br/>
A word to all who on Him call<br/>
For life in paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
From the cross the Savior cries,<br/>
“Come with Me to paradise;<br/>
Look to Me, believe and live,<br/>
Accept the life I freely give.”<br/>
<br/>
The dying thief, in full belief,<br/>
On Jesus fixed his eyes;<br/>
His only plea, “Remember me,<br/>
O Lord, in paradise.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
By man condemned, without a friend,<br/>
Will Jesus heed his cries?<br/>
O blessèd Lord, how quick Thy word,<br/>
“Today in paradise.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Tho’ vile as he, O sinner, flee<br/>
While Jesus calls, be wise;<br/>
His word believe, and now receive<br/>
A life in paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
