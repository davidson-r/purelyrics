title: Praises Of That Saint We Sing

<center>
The praises of that saint we sing,<br/>
To whom all lands their tribute bring,<br/>
Who with indomitable heart,<br/>
Bore throughout life true womanâ€™s heart.<br/>
<br/>
Restraining every forward sense<br/>
By gentle bonds of abstinence,<br/>
With prayer her hungry souls she fed,<br/>
And thus to heavenly joys hath sped.<br/>
<br/>
King Christ, from Whom all virtue springs,<br/>
Who only doest wondrous things,<br/>
As now to Thee she kneels in prayer,<br/>
In mercy our petitions hear.<br/>
<br/>
All praise to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;<br/>
Whom with the Spirit we adore<br/>
Forever and forevermore.
