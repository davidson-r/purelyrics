<br/>
Prisoners of hope, arise, and see your Lord appear;<br/>
Lo! on the wings of love He flies, and brings redemption near;<br/>
Redemption in His blood He calls you to receive:<br/>
“Look unto Me, the pardoning God. Believe,” He cries, “believe!”<br/>
<br/>
The reconciling word, we thankfully embrace;<br/>
Rejoice in our redeeming Lord, a blood besprinkled race.<br/>
We yield to be set free; Thy counsel we approve;<br/>
Salvation, praise, ascribe to Thee, and glory in Thy love.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, to Thee we look, till saved from sin’s remains;<br/>
Reject the inbred tyrant’s yoke, and cast away his chains.<br/>
Our nature shall no more over us dominion have;<br/>
By faith we apprehend the power which shall forever save.<br/>
