Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!<br/>
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!<br/>
All ye who hear, now to His temple draw near;<br/>
Praise Him in glad adoration.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, Who over all things so wondrously reigneth,<br/>
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!<br/>
Hast thou not seen how thy desires ever have been<br/>
Granted in what He ordaineth?<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, Who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee;<br/>
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.<br/>
What need or grief ever hath failed of relief?<br/>
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, Who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;<br/>
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.<br/>
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,<br/>
If with His love He befriend thee.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, Who, when tempests their warfare are waging,<br/>
Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,<br/>
Biddeth them cease, turneth their fury to peace,<br/>
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, Who, when darkness of sin is abounding,<br/>
Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,<br/>
Sheddeth His light, chaseth the horrors of night,<br/>
Saints with His mercy surrounding.<br/>
<br/>
Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore Him!<br/>
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him.<br/>
Let the Amen sound from His people again,<br/>
Gladly for aye we adore Him.
