title: Prayer is the key

<br/>
Prayer is the key for the bending knee<br/>
To open the morn’s first hours;<br/>
See the incense rise to the starry skies,<br/>
Like perfume from the flow’rs.<br/>
<br/>
Not a soul so sad, nor a heart so glad<br/>
When cometh the shades of night,<br/>
But the daybreak song will the joy prolong,<br/>
And some darkness turn to light.<br/>
<br/>
Take the golden key in your hand and see,<br/>
As the night-tide drifts away,<br/>
How its blessèd hold is a crown of gold,<br/>
Thro’ the weary hours of day.<br/>
<br/>
When the shadows fall, and the vesper call<br/>
Is sobbing its low refrain,<br/>
’Tis a garland sweet to the toil-dent feet,<br/>
And an antidote for pain.<br/>
<br/>
Soon our toils will cease, and will come release;<br/>
Life’s tears shall be wiped away,<br/>
As the pearl gates swing, and the gold harps ring,<br/>
And we enter eternal day.<br/>
