<br/>
Peace, troubled soul, thou need’st not fear;<br/>
Thy great Provider still is near;<br/>
Who fed thee last, will feed thee still:<br/>
Be calm, and sink into His will.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord, who built the earth and sky,<br/>
In mercy stoops to hear thy cry;<br/>
His promise all may freely claim;<br/>
Ask and receive in Jesus’ Name.<br/>
<br/>
Without reserve give Christ your heart,<br/>
Let Him His righteousness impart;<br/>
Then all things else He’ll freely give;<br/>
With Him you all things shall receive.<br/>
<br/>
Thus shall the soul be truly blest,<br/>
That seeks in God His only rest;<br/>
May I that happy person be,<br/>
In time and in eternity.<br/>
