<br/>
To me the Holy Ghost is giv’n,<br/>
An earnest of the joys of Heav’n;<br/>
Since He has taken full control,<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul,<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul;<br/>
The Spirit has come, has come to abide;<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit dwells my heart within<br/>
And breaks the pow’r of pardoned sin;<br/>
Tho’ o’er my head dark clouds may roll,<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O holy rest! O peace sublime!<br/>
He reigns within me all the time;<br/>
He purifies and makes me whole—<br/>
I’ve Pentecost in my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then seek this Gift without delay,<br/>
Receive the Holy Ghost today;<br/>
Yield all to His benign control,<br/>
Let Pentecost fill your soul!<br/>
O yes!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
