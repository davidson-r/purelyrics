<br/>
The people that in darkness walked<br/>
Have seen a wondrous light,<br/>
A light that beamed afar,<br/>
The bright and morning star,<br/>
And those that dwelt in death’s dark vale<br/>
Have felt their joy increase,<br/>
Their constant theme shall be,<br/>
“All hail the Prince of Peace.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful, Counselor!<br/>
The everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace,<br/>
Wonderful, Counselor!<br/>
The everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.<br/>
<br/>
As men rejoice when they divide<br/>
The spoils which they have gained,<br/>
So shall it ever be,<br/>
When Christ shall set them free.<br/>
For He shall break the shoulder’s staff,<br/>
The rod of the oppressed,<br/>
And every battle won,<br/>
As victors we shall rest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For unto us a Child is born,<br/>
To us a Son is giv’n;<br/>
His kingdom shall increase,<br/>
And never, never cease,<br/>
Upon the throne of David shall<br/>
He reign forevermore,<br/>
Till ev’ry knee shall bow<br/>
And ev’ry heart adore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
