<br/>
Pour down Thy Spirit from above,<br/>
And bid all strife and discord cease;<br/>
Joint heart to heart in mutual love,<br/>
O reign among us, Prince of Peace.<br/>
<br/>
If in the souls where love should be<br/>
Arise the storms of fierce self-will,<br/>
Calm Thou that troubled, angry sea,<br/>
Speak to the tempest, “Peace, be still.”<br/>
<br/>
If rude reproach be o’er us flung,<br/>
And slander wound as with a sword,<br/>
Rule Thou th’unruly answering tongue,<br/>
And silence every vengeful word.<br/>
<br/>
Whene’er in this wild world we meet,<br/>
Unkindly deeds that anger move,<br/>
Teach us forgiveness, triumph sweet,<br/>
To conquer evil will with love.<br/>
<br/>
In every land, in every home,<br/>
In every heart let love increase;<br/>
Let love proclaim Thy kingdom come,<br/>
O reign among us, Prince of Peace.<br/>
