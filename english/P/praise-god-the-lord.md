<br/>
Praise God the Lord, ye sons of men,<br/>
Before His highest throne;<br/>
Today He opens Heav’n again<br/>
And gives us His own Son.<br/>
<br/>
He leaves His heav’nly Father’s throne<br/>
Is born an Infant small,<br/>
And in a manger, poor and lone,<br/>
Lies in a humble stall.<br/>
<br/>
He veils in flesh His power divine<br/>
A servant’s form to take;<br/>
In want and lowliness must pine<br/>
Who Heav’n and earth did make.<br/>
<br/>
He nestles at His mother’s breast,<br/>
Receives her tender care,<br/>
Whom angels hail with joy most blest,<br/>
King David’s royal Heir.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis He who in these latter days<br/>
From Judah’s tribe should come,<br/>
By Whom the Father would upraise<br/>
The Church, His Christendom.<br/>
<br/>
A wondrous change which He does make!<br/>
He takes our flesh and blood,<br/>
And He conceals for sinners’ sake<br/>
His majesty of God.<br/>
<br/>
He serves that I a lord may be;<br/>
A great exchange indeed!<br/>
Could Jesus’ love do more for me<br/>
To help me in my need?<br/>
<br/>
He opens us again the door<br/>
Of paradise today;<br/>
The angel guards the gate no more<br/>
To God our thanks we pay.<br/>
