title: Palms Of Glory

<center>
Palms of glory, raiment bright,<br/>
Crowns that never fade away,<br/>
Gird and deck the saints in light,<br/>
Priests, and kings, and conquerors they.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the conquerors bring their palms<br/>
To the Lamb amidst the throne,<br/>
And proclaim in joyful psalms<br/>
Victory through His cross alone.<br/>
<br/>
Kings for harps their crowns resign,<br/>
Crying, as they strike the chords,<br/>
“Take the kingdom, it is Thine,<br/>
King of kings, and Lord of lords.”<br/>
<br/>
Round the altar priests confess,<br/>
If their robes are white as snow,<br/>
’Twas the Savior’s righteousness<br/>
And His blood that made them so.<br/>
<br/>
They were mortal too like us;<br/>
O, when we like them shall die,<br/>
May our souls translated thus<br/>
Triumph, reign, and shine on high.
