title: Preserve me Lord

<center>
Preserve me, Lord, in time of need;<br/>
For succor to Thy throne I flee,<br/>
But have no merits there to plead:<br/>
My goodness cannot reach to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Oft have my heart and tongue confessed<br/>
How empty and how poor I am;<br/>
My praise can never make Thee blessed,<br/>
Nor add new glories to Thy Name.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, Lord, Thy saints on earth may reap<br/>
Some profit by the good we do;<br/>
These are the company I keep,<br/>
These are the choicest friends I know.<br/>
<br/>
Let others choose the songs of mirth<br/>
To give a relish to their wine;<br/>
I love the men of heavâ€™nly birth,<br/>
Whose thoughts and language are divine.
