title: Promoted To Glory

<center>
Summoned home, the call has sounded,<br/>
Bidding a soldier his warfare cease;<br/>
And the song of angels resounded,<br/>
Welcomes a warrior to eternal peace.<br/>
Praise the Lord! from earthly struggles<br/>
A comrade has found release.<br/>
Death has lost its sting, the grave its victory;<br/>
Conflicts and dangers are over;<br/>
See him honored in the throne of glory,<br/>
Crowned by the hand of Jehovah!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Strife and sorrow over,<br/>
The Lord’s true faithful soldier<br/>
Has been called to go from the ranks below,<br/>
To the conq’ring host above.<br/>
<br/>
Once the sword, but now the scepter,<br/>
Once the fight, now the rest and fame,<br/>
Broken every earthly fetter,<br/>
Now the glory for the cross and shame;<br/>
Once the loss of all for Jesus,<br/>
But now the eternal gain.<br/>
Trials and sorrow here have found their meaning<br/>
Mysteries their explanation;<br/>
Safe, forever in the sunlight gleaming<br/>
Of His eternal salvation.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
