<br/>
Prayer is appointed to convey<br/>
The blessings God designs to give:<br/>
Long as they live should Christians pray;<br/>
They learn to pray when first they live.<br/>
<br/>
If pain afflict, or wrongs oppress;<br/>
If cares distract, or fears dismay;<br/>
If guilt deject, if sin distress;<br/>
In every case, still watch and pray.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis prayer supports the soul that’s weak;<br/>
Though thought be broken, language lame,<br/>
Pray, if thou canst or canst not speak;<br/>
But pray with faith in Jesus’ name.<br/>
<br/>
Depend on Him; thou canst not fail;<br/>
Make all thy wants and wishes known;<br/>
Fear not; His merits must prevail:<br/>
Ask but in faith, it shall be done.<br/>
