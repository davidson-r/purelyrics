<br/>
There’s a holy and beautiful city<br/>
Whose Builder and Ruler is God;<br/>
John saw it descending from Heaven,<br/>
When Patmos, in exile, he trod;<br/>
Its high, massive wall is of jasper,<br/>
The city itself is pure gold;<br/>
And when my frail tent here is folded,<br/>
Mine eyes shall its glory behold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In that bright city, pearly white city,<br/>
I have a mansion, a harp, and a crown;<br/>
Now I am watching, waiting, and longing,<br/>
For the white city that’s soon coming down.<br/>
<br/>
No sin is allowed in that city<br/>
And nothing defiling or mean;<br/>
No pain and no sickness can enter,<br/>
No crepe on the doorknob is seen;<br/>
Earth’s sorrows and cares are forgotten,<br/>
No tempter is there to annoy;<br/>
No parting words ever are spoken,<br/>
There’s nothing to hurt or destroy.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No heartaches are known in that city,<br/>
No tears ever moisten the eyes;<br/>
There’s no disappointment in Heaven,<br/>
No envy and strife in the sky;<br/>
The saints are all sanctified wholly,<br/>
They live in sweet harmony there;<br/>
My heart is now set on that city,<br/>
And some day its blessings I’ll share.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
My loved ones are gathering yonder,<br/>
My friends too are passing away,<br/>
And soon I shall join their bright number,<br/>
And dwell in eternity’s day;<br/>
They’re safe now in glory with Jesus,<br/>
Their trials and battles are past.<br/>
They overcame sin and the tempter,<br/>
They’ve reached that fair city at last.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
