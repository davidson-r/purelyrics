title: Year Is Gone Beyond Recall
---

---
<center>
The year is gone, beyond recall,<br/>
With all its hopes and fears,<br/>
With all its bright and gladdening smiles,<br/>
With all its mourners’ tears.<br/>
<br/>
Thy thankful people praise Thee, Lord,<br/>
For countless gifts received;<br/>
And pray for grace to keep the faith<br/>
Which saints of old believed.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee we come, O gracious Lord,<br/>
The newborn year to bless;<br/>
Defend our land from pestilence,<br/>
Give peace and plenteousness.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive this nation’s many sins,<br/>
The growth of vice restrain;<br/>
And help us all with sin to strive,<br/>
And crowns of life to gain.<br/>
<br/>
From evil deeds that stain the past<br/>
We now desire to flee;<br/>
And pray that future years may all<br/>
Be spent, good Lord, for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, let Thy watchful eye<br/>
Still look on us in love,<br/>
That we may praise Thee, year by year,<br/>
With angel hosts above.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Father be,<br/>
All glory to the Son,<br/>
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,<br/>
While endless ages run.
