<br/>
A year of precious blessings<br/>
And glorious victories won,<br/>
Of earnest work progressing,<br/>
Its onward course has run;<br/>
To Thee, O God, our Refuge,<br/>
Whose goodness crowns our days,<br/>
Within Thy earthly temple,<br/>
We lift our souls in praise;<br/>
Within Thy earthly temple,<br/>
We lift our souls in praise.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Master of assemblies<br/>
In mighty power descend,<br/>
Behold our glad reunion,<br/>
Conduct it to the end;<br/>
Inspire our hearts with courage<br/>
And deeper love for Thee,<br/>
That all, Thy Name may honor,<br/>
Where’er our field may be,<br/>
That all, Thy Name may honor,<br/>
Where’er our field may be.<br/>
<br/>
O Church of God’s anointed,<br/>
March on the world to win,<br/>
Lead forth thy ranks by millions<br/>
Against the hosts of sin,<br/>
Till at His throne in glory,<br/>
Where angels prostrate fall,<br/>
One hallelujah chorus<br/>
Shall crown Him Lord of all,<br/>
One hallelujah chorus<br/>
Shall crown Him Lord of all.<br/>
