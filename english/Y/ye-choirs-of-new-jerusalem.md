title: Ye Choirs Of New Jerusalem

<center>
Ye choirs of new Jerusalem,<br/>
Your sweetest notes employ,<br/>
The Paschal victory to hymn<br/>
In strains of holy joy.<br/>
<br/>
For Judah’s Lion bursts His chains,<br/>
Crushing the serpent’s head;<br/>
And cries aloud through death’s domains<br/>
To wake the imprisoned dead.<br/>
<br/>
From hell’s devouring jaws the prey<br/>
Alone our Leader bore;<br/>
His ransomed hosts pursue their way<br/>
Where Jesus goes before.<br/>
<br/>
Triumphant in His glory now<br/>
To Him all power is given;<br/>
To Him in one communion bow<br/>
All saints in earth and heaven.<br/>
<br/>
While we, His soldiers, praise our King,<br/>
His mercy we implore,<br/>
Within His palace bright to bring<br/>
And keep us evermore.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Father be,<br/>
All glory to the Son,<br/>
All glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,<br/>
While endless ages run.
