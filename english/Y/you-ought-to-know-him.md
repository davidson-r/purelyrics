<br/>
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,<br/>
He is a Savior tender and true;<br/>
Jesus, my King—how I adore Him!<br/>
And He should be as precious to you.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,<br/>
Will you receive His greeting today?<br/>
Waiting He stands, tenderly pleading:<br/>
“I am the Life, the Truth, and the Way.”<br/>
<br/>
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,<br/>
He is a faithful Shepherd and Guide;<br/>
Sorrow He shares, burdens He lightens,<br/>
Ev’ry good thing by Him is supplied.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I have a Friend—you ought to know Him,<br/>
Will you not let Him enter your heart?<br/>
Peace He will give you without measure,<br/>
Blessing untold, that will not depart.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
