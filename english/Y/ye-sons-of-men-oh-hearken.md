<br/>
Ye sons of men, oh, hearken:<br/>
Your heart and mind prepare;<br/>
To hail th’almighty Savior,<br/>
Oh sinners, be your care.<br/>
He Who of grace alone<br/>
Our Life and Light was given,<br/>
The promised Lord from Heaven,<br/>
Unto our world is shown.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare the way before Him;<br/>
Prepare for Him the best.<br/>
Cast out whate’er offendeth<br/>
This great, this heav’nly Guest.<br/>
Make straight, make plain, the way:<br/>
The lowly valleys raising,<br/>
The heights of pride abasing,<br/>
His path all even lay.<br/>
<br/>
The humble heart and lowly<br/>
God lifteth up on high;<br/>
Beneath His feet in anguish<br/>
The haughty soul shall lie.<br/>
The heart, sincere and right,<br/>
That heeds God’s invitation<br/>
And makes true preparation,<br/>
It is the Lord’s delight.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare my heart, Lord Jesus,<br/>
Turn not from me aside,<br/>
And grant that I receive Thee<br/>
This blessèd Adventide.<br/>
From stall and manger low<br/>
Come Thou to dwell within me;<br/>
Loud praises will I sing Thee<br/>
And forth Thy glory show.<br/>
