<br/>
If you cannot, on the ocean, sail among the swiftest fleet,<br/>
Rocking on the highest billows, laughing at the storms you meet,<br/>
You can stand among the sailors, anchored yet within the bay,<br/>
You can lend a hand to help them, as they launch their boats away.<br/>
<br/>
If you are too weak to journey up the mountain steep and high,<br/>
You can stand within the valley, while the multitudes go by;<br/>
You can chant in happy measure, as they slowly pass along;<br/>
Though they may forget the singer, they will not forget the song.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not gold and silver ever ready to command;<br/>
If you cannot toward the needy reach an ever open hand;<br/>
You can visit the afflicted, o’er the erring you can weep;<br/>
You can be a true disciple, sitting at the Savior’s feet.<br/>
<br/>
If you cannot, in the conflict prove, yourself a soldier true,<br/>
If, where fire and smoke are thickest, there’s no work for you to do;<br/>
When the battlefield is silent, you can go with careful tread,<br/>
You can bear away the wounded, you can cover up the dead.<br/>
<br/>
If you cannot, in the harvest, gather up the richest sheaves,<br/>
Many a grain both ripe and golden oft the careless reaper leaves;<br/>
Go and glean among the briars growing rank against the wall,<br/>
For it may be that their shadow hides the heaviest wheat of all.<br/>
<br/>
Do not, then, stand idly waiting, for some greater work to do;<br/>
Fortune is a lazy goddess, she will never come to you.<br/>
Go and toil in any vineyard, do not fear to do or dare,<br/>
If you want a field of labor, you can find it anywhere.<br/>
