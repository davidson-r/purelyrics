<center>
Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,<br/>
And publish abroad His wonderful Name;<br/>
The Name all victorious of Jesus extol,<br/>
His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.<br/>
<br/>
The waves of the sea have lift up their voice,<br/>
Sore troubled that we in Jesus rejoice;<br/>
The floods they are roaring, but Jesus is here;<br/>
While we are adoring, He always is near.<br/>
<br/>
When devils engage, the billows arise,<br/>
And horribly rage, and threaten the skies:<br/>
Their fury shall never our steadfastness shock,<br/>
The weakest believer is built on a rock.<br/>
<br/>
God ruleth on high, almighty to save,<br/>
And still He is nigh, His presence we have;<br/>
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,<br/>
Ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.<br/>
<br/>
“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”<br/>
Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;<br/>
The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,<br/>
Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.<br/>
<br/>
Then let us adore and give Him His right,<br/>
All glory and power, all wisdom and might;<br/>
All honor and blessing with angels above,<br/>
And thanks never ceasing and infinite love.
