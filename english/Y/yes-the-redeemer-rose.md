<br/>
Yes, the Redeemer rose, the Savior left the dead,<br/>
And o’er our hellish foes high raised His conquering head.<br/>
In wild dismay the guards around,<br/>
Fall to the ground and sink away.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! the angelic bands in full assembly meet,<br/>
To wait His high commands and worship at His feet.<br/>
Joyful they come, and wing their way<br/>
From realms of day to see His tomb.<br/>
<br/>
Then back to Heav’n they fly and the glad tidings bear.<br/>
Hark! as they soar on high, what music fills the air!<br/>
Their anthems say, “Jesus, Who bled,<br/>
Hath left the dead, He rose today.”<br/>
<br/>
Ye mortals, catch the sound, redeemed by Him from hell;<br/>
And send the echo round the globe on which you dwell:<br/>
Transported, cry, “Jesus, Who bled,<br/>
Hath left the dead, no more to die.”<br/>
<br/>
All hail! triumphant Lord, Who sav’st us with Thy blood;<br/>
Wide be Thy Name adored, Thou rising, reigning God!<br/>
With Thee we rise, with Thee we reign,<br/>
And empires gain beyond the skies.<br/>
