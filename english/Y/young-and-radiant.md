<br/>
Young and radiant, He is standing,<br/>
As He stood at Salem’s shrine;<br/>
Just a lad, a lad forever,<br/>
With a look and grace divine!<br/>
“Tell me, how it is ye sought Me?<br/>
Wist ye not My Father’s plan?<br/>
I must be about His business,<br/>
Would I be a Son of Man.”<br/>
<br/>
I can see Him humbly kneeling,<br/>
As He knelt upon the hill;<br/>
While the waters hushed their music,<br/>
And the night grew bright and still:<br/>
“Brothers, tell Me why ye sought Me?<br/>
Wist ye not My Father’s plan?<br/>
He must grow in grace and wisdom,<br/>
Who would be a Son of Man.”<br/>
<br/>
Like a flame His soul is striking<br/>
In His wrath at greed and shame;<br/>
“Ye have made a den of robbers<br/>
Of the temple to His Name;<br/>
Know ye not His equal justice?<br/>
Wist ye not My Father’s plan?<br/>
He must bathe His sword in Heaven<br/>
Who would be a Son of Man.”<br/>
<br/>
I can see Him dying, loving<br/>
Unto death on Calvary;<br/>
His dear hands still pleading, praying,<br/>
Worn and torn for you and me!<br/>
“Brothers, will ye scorn and leave Me?<br/>
Wist ye not My Father’s plan?<br/>
He must wear a crown of sorrow<br/>
Who would be a Son of Man.”<br/>
