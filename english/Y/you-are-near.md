title: You Are Near

<br/>
Yahweh, I know you are near, <br/>
standing always at my side. <br/>
You guard me from the foe, <br/>
and you lead me in ways everlasting. <br/>
<br/>
Lord, you have searched my heart, <br/>
and you know when I sit and when I stand. <br/>
Your hand is upon me protecting me from death, <br/>
keeping me from harm.<br/>
<br/>
Where can I run from Your love? <br/>
If I climb to the heavens You are there; <br/>
If I fly to the sunrise or sail beyond the sea, <br/>
still I'd find You there.<br/>
<br/>
You know my heart and its ways, <br/>
you who formed me before I was born <br/>
in the secret of darkness before I saw the sun <br/>
in my mother's womb.<br/>
<br/>
Marvelous to me are Your works; <br/>
how profound are Your thoughts, my Lord. <br/>
Even if I could count them, they number as the stars, <br/>
You would still be there. <br/>
