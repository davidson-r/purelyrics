Have you spent a pleasant day?<br/>
Come again, come again.<br/>
Would you learn the better way?<br/>
Then come, come again.<br/>
Here you’ll find a welcome true,<br/>
Hearts that warmly beat for you;<br/>
They will tell you what do<br/>
O come, come again.<br/>
Have you spent a pleasant day?<br/>
Come again, come again.<br/>
Would you learn the better way?<br/>
Then come, come again.<br/>
<br/>
Would you leave all sinful ways?<br/>
Come again, come again.<br/>
Would you join our cheerful lays?<br/>
Then come, come again.<br/>
We are bound for Canaan’s land,<br/>
Will you come and join our band?<br/>
We will take you by the hand,<br/>
O come, come again.<br/>
Would you leave all sinful ways?<br/>
Come again, come again.<br/>
Would you join our cheerful lays?<br/>
Then come, come again.<br/>
<br/>
Words of comfort you shall hear,<br/>
Come again, come again;<br/>
From the Book we love so dear,<br/>
Then come, come, again;<br/>
Jesus suffered on the tree,<br/>
Jesus died for you and me,<br/>
His disciple you may be,<br/>
O come, come, again.<br/>
Words of comfort you shall hear,<br/>
Come again, come again;<br/>
From the Book we love so dear,<br/>
Then come, come, again;<br/>
<br/>
Come on every Sabbath day,<br/>
Come again, come again;<br/>
Never, never stay away,<br/>
O come, come again;<br/>
Now improve the hours that fly,<br/>
They are gliding swiftly by,<br/>
You are not too young to die,<br/>
Then come, come again.<br/>
Come on every Sabbath day,<br/>
Come again, come again;<br/>
Never, never stay away,<br/>
O come, come again.
