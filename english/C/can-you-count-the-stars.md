<br/>
Can you count the stars that brightly<br/>
Twinkle in the midnight sky?<br/>
Can you count the clouds, so lightly<br/>
O’er the meadows floating by?<br/>
God, the Lord, doth mark their number,<br/>
With His eyes that never slumber;<br/>
He hath made them every one,<br/>
He hath made them every one.<br/>
<br/>
Can you count the wings now flashing<br/>
In the sunshine’s golden light?<br/>
Can you count the fishes splashing<br/>
In the cooling waters bright?<br/>
God, the Lord, a name hath given,<br/>
To all creatures under Heaven;<br/>
He hath named them every one,<br/>
He hath named them every one.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how many children<br/>
Rise each morning blithe and gay?<br/>
Can you count their jolly voices,<br/>
Singing sweetly day by day?<br/>
God hears all the happy voices,<br/>
In their merry songs rejoices;<br/>
And He loves them, every one<br/>
And He loves them, every one. <br/>
