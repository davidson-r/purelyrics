<br/>
Come, let us anew our journey pursue,<br/>
Roll round with the year,<br/>
And never stand still till the Master appear,<br/>
His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,<br/>
And our talents improve,<br/>
By the patience of hope, and the labor of love,<br/>
By the patience of hope, and the labor of love.<br/>
<br/>
Our life is a dream; our time, as a stream,<br/>
Glides swiftly away,<br/>
And the fugitive moment refuses to stay,<br/>
The arrow is flown, the moment is gone;<br/>
The millennial year<br/>
Rushes on to our view, and eternity’s here,<br/>
Rushes on to our view, and eternity’s here.<br/>
<br/>
O that each in the day of His coming may say,<br/>
“I have fought my way through;<br/>
I have finished the work Thou didst give me to do!”<br/>
O that each from his Lord may receive the glad word,<br/>
“Well and faithfully done!<br/>
Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne!”<br/>
“Enter into My joy, and sit down on My throne!”<br/>
