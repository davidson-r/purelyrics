Jesus is our loving Savior,<br/>
He, our best, our constant Friend;<br/>
In His service life is pleasure,<br/>
For He loveth to the end.<br/>
Loving Savior, loving Savior,<br/>
Here we at Thy footstool bend,<br/>
Here we at Thy footstool bend.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus is the children’s Savior!<br/>
’Twas for them He shed his blood;<br/>
Died, that poor and needy sinners<br/>
Might be reconciled to God.<br/>
Dying Savior! Dying Savior!<br/>
Bearing thus our sinful load,<br/>
Bearing thus our sinful load.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus is the children’s Savior!<br/>
“Suffer them,” He says, “to come.”<br/>
If they seek His face and favor,<br/>
They shall share His heav’nly home.<br/>
Risen Savior! Risen Savior!<br/>
Never more from Thee to roam,<br/>
Never more from Thee to roam.<br/>
<br/>
Loving suff’ring, dying Savior!<br/>
Risen, glorious on Thy throne,<br/>
Haste the day when every idol<br/>
Shall by truth be overthrown.<br/>
And the kingdoms, and the kingdoms<br/>
Of the earth to Thee belong,<br/>
Of the earth to Thee belong.<br/>
