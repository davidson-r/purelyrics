<br/>
Comfort, comfort ye My people,<br/>
Speak ye peace, thus saith our God;<br/>
Comfort those who sit in darkness,<br/>
Mourning ’neath their sorrow’s load;<br/>
Speak ye to Jerusalem<br/>
Of the peace that waits for them;<br/>
Tell her that her sins I cover,<br/>
And her warfare now is over.<br/>
<br/>
For the herald’s voice is crying<br/>
In the desert far and near,<br/>
Bidding all men to repentance,<br/>
Since the kingdom now is here.<br/>
O that warning cry obey!<br/>
Now prepare for God a way!<br/>
Let the valleys rise to meet Him,<br/>
And the hills bow down to greet Him.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, her sins our God will pardon,<br/>
Blotting out each dark misdeed;<br/>
All that well deserved His anger<br/>
He will no more see nor heed.<br/>
She has suffered many a day,<br/>
Now her griefs have passed away,<br/>
God will change her pining sadness<br/>
Into ever springing gladness.<br/>
<br/>
Make ye straight what long was crooked,<br/>
Make the rougher places plain:<br/>
Let your hearts be true and humble,<br/>
As befits His holy reign,<br/>
For the glory of the Lord<br/>
Now o’er the earth is shed abroad,<br/>
And all flesh shall see the token<br/>
That His Word is never broken.<br/>
