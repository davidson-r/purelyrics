Come, ye thankful people, come, raise the song of harvest home;<br/>
All is safely gathered in, ere the winter storms begin.<br/>
God our Maker doth provide for our wants to be supplied;<br/>
Come to God’s own temple, come, raise the song of harvest home.<br/>
<br/>
All the world is God’s own field, fruit unto His praise to yield;<br/>
Wheat and tares together sown unto joy or sorrow grown.<br/>
First the blade and then the ear, then the full corn shall appear;<br/>
Lord of harvest, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be.<br/>
<br/>
For the Lord our God shall come, and shall take His harvest home;<br/>
From His field shall in that day all offenses purge away,<br/>
Giving angels charge at last in the fire the tares to cast;<br/>
But the fruitful ears to store in His garner evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, Lord, quickly come, bring Thy final harvest home;<br/>
Gather Thou Thy people in, free from sorrow, free from sin,<br/>
There, forever purified, in Thy garner to abide;<br/>
Come, with all Thine angels come, raise the glorious harvest home.
