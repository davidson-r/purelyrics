<br/>
O tell me, gentle shepherd,<br/>
Gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd,<br/>
O tell me what the angels sang<br/>
In the early Christmas morn.<br/>
O tell me what the angels sang<br/>
In the early Christmas morn.<br/>
<br/>
O listen, happy children,<br/>
Happy children, happy children,<br/>
While I tell you what the angels sang<br/>
In the early Christmas morn.<br/>
“Fear ye not, I bring good tidings,<br/>
For today the Lord is born!”<br/>
<br/>
O tell me, gentle shepherd,<br/>
Gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd,<br/>
What the great bright host of angels sang,<br/>
All out in the fields so still.<br/>
What the great bright host of angels sang,<br/>
All out in the fields so still.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you, Christian children,<br/>
Christian children, Christian children,<br/>
What the great bright host of angels sang,<br/>
All out in the fields so still:<br/>
“Glory in the highest, glory!<br/>
Peace on earth, to all goodwill!”<br/>
<br/>
Let us keep, then, happy Christmas,<br/>
Happy Christmas, happy Christmas,<br/>
Children, shepherds, folks, and angels<br/>
All the blest song repeating still:<br/>
“Glory in the highest, glory!<br/>
Peace on earth, to all goodwill!”<br/>
