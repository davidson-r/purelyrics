<br/>
Creation’s Lord, we give Thee thanks<br/>
That this Thy world is incomplete;<br/>
That battle calls our marshaled ranks;<br/>
That work awaits our hands and feet.<br/>
<br/>
That Thou hast not yet finished man;<br/>
That we are in the making still,<br/>
As friends who share the Maker’s plan<br/>
As sons who know the Father’s will.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the present sin and shame,<br/>
Wrong’s bitter, cruel, scorching blight,<br/>
We see the beckoning vision flame,<br/>
The blessèd kingdom of the right.<br/>
<br/>
What though the kingdom long delay,<br/>
And still with haughty foes must cope?<br/>
It gives us that for which to pray,<br/>
A field for toil and faith and hope.<br/>
<br/>
Since what we choose is what we are,<br/>
And what we love we yet shall be,<br/>
The goal may ever shine afar<br/>
The will to win it makes us free.<br/>
