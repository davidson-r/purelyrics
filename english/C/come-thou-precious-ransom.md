<br/>
Come, Thou precious Ransom, come,<br/>
Only Hope for sinful mortals!<br/>
Come, O Savior of the world!<br/>
Open are to Thee all portals.<br/>
Come, Thy beauty let us see;<br/>
Anxiously we wait for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Enter now my waiting heart,<br/>
Glorious King and Lord most holy.<br/>
Dwell in me and ne’er depart,<br/>
Though I am but poor and lowly.<br/>
Ah, what riches will be mine<br/>
When Thou art my Guest Divine!<br/>
<br/>
My hosannas and my palms<br/>
Graciously receive, I pray Thee;<br/>
Evermore, as best I can,<br/>
Savior, I will homage pay Thee,<br/>
And in faith I will embrace,<br/>
Lord, Thy merit through Thy grace.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, hosanna, David’s Son!<br/>
Help, Lord, hear our supplication!<br/>
Let Thy kingdom, scepter, crown,<br/>
Bring us blessing and salvation,<br/>
That forever we may sing:<br/>
Hail, hosanna! to our King.<br/>
