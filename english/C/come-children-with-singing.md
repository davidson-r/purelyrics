<br/>
Come children, with singing, with sweet voices ringing,<br/>
Come kneel to the Babe that in Bethlehem lies,<br/>
While angels achoir, with pinions of fire,<br/>
Are filling with music the listening skies.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat the dear story how, veiling His glory,<br/>
The Hope of the Ages came down to the earth,<br/>
Oh, worship Him lowly, the lofty and holy<br/>
Our Star of the Morning shone out at His birth.<br/>
<br/>
See Mary enfold Him, while shepherds behold Him.<br/>
And sages are bent at His beautiful feet.<br/>
Come, haste to adore Him, and, bowing before Him,<br/>
The Lord who redeems you in reverence greet.<br/>
<br/>
This wonderful Stranger, His couch is a manger,<br/>
His cradle is made with the cattle in stall;<br/>
Yet God of creation in blest incarnation,<br/>
He stoops to our nature to ransom us all.<br/>
