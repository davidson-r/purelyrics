<br/>
Crown Him with many crowns, the Lamb upon His throne.<br/>
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own.<br/>
Awake, my soul, and sing of Him who died for thee,<br/>
And hail Him as thy matchless King through all eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the virgin’s Son, the God incarnate born,<br/>
Whose arm those crimson trophies won which now His brow adorn;<br/>
Fruit of the mystic rose, as of that rose the stem;<br/>
The root whence mercy ever flows, the Babe of Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Son of God, before the worlds began,<br/>
And ye who tread where He hath trod, crown Him the Son of Man;<br/>
Who every grief hath known that wrings the human breast,<br/>
And takes and bears them for His own, that all in Him may rest.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of life, who triumphed over the grave,<br/>
And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save.<br/>
His glories now we sing, Who died, and rose on high,<br/>
Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways<br/>
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise.<br/>
His reign shall know no end, and round His piercèd feet<br/>
Fair flowers of paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of love, behold His hands and side,<br/>
Those wounds, yet visible above, in beauty glorified.<br/>
No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,<br/>
But downward bends his burning eye at mysteries so bright.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of Heaven, enthroned in worlds above,<br/>
Crown Him the King to Whom is given the wondrous name of Love.<br/>
Crown Him with many crowns, as thrones before Him fall;<br/>
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, for He is King of all.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of lords, who over all doth reign,<br/>
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, for ransomed sinners slain,<br/>
Now lives in realms of light, where saints with angels sing<br/>
Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.<br/>
<br/>
Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time,<br/>
Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime.<br/>
All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou has died for me;<br/>
Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.<br/>
