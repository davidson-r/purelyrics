<br/>
Calm on the listening ear of night<br/>
Come heaven’s melodious strains,<br/>
Where wild Judea stretches forth<br/>
Her silver mantled plains.<br/>
Celestial choirs from courts above<br/>
Shed sacred glories there,<br/>
And angels, with their sparkling lyres,<br/>
Make music on the air.<br/>
<br/>
The answering hills of Palestine<br/>
Send back the glad reply;<br/>
And greet, from all their holy heights,<br/>
The Day-Spring from on high.<br/>
O’er the blue depths of Galilee<br/>
There comes a holier calm,<br/>
And Sharon waves, in solemn praise,<br/>
Her silent groves of palm.<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God!” the lofty strain<br/>
The realm of ether fills;<br/>
How sweeps the song of solemn joy<br/>
O’er Judah’s sacred hills!<br/>
“Glory to God!” the sounding skies<br/>
Loud with their anthems ring,<br/>
“Peace to the earth; good will to men,<br/>
From heaven’s eternal King!”<br/>
<br/>
Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!<br/>
The Savior now is born,<br/>
And bright on Bethlehem’s joyous plains<br/>
Breaks the first Christmas morn.<br/>
And brightly on Moriah’s brow<br/>
Crowned with her temple spires,<br/>
Which first proclaim the newborn light,<br/>
Clothed with its orient fires.<br/>
<br/>
This day shall Christian tongues be mute,<br/>
And Christian hearts be cold?<br/>
Oh, catch the anthem that from heaven<br/>
O’er Judah’s mountains rolled.<br/>
When burst upon that listening night<br/>
The high and solemn lay:<br/>
“Glory to God, on earth be peace,”<br/>
Salvation comes today!<br/>
