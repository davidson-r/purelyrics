<br/>
There’s a city that looks o’er the valley of death,<br/>
And the glories can never be told;<br/>
There the sun never sets, and the leaves never fade,<br/>
In that beautiful city of gold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
There the sun never sets, and the leaves never fade;<br/>
And the eyes of the faithful our Savior behold,<br/>
In that beautiful city of gold.<br/>
<br/>
There the King, our Redeemer, the Lord whom we love,<br/>
All the faithful with rapture behold;<br/>
There the righteous forever shall shine as the stars,<br/>
In that beautiful city of gold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Every soul we have led to the foot of the cross,<br/>
Every lamb we have brought to the fold,<br/>
Shall be kept as bright jewels our crown to adorn,<br/>
In that beautiful city of gold.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
