<br/>
Come, ye saints, look here and wonder<br/>
See the place where Jesus lay:<br/>
He has burst His bands asunder;<br/>
He has borne our sins away;<br/>
Joyful tidings, joyful tidings,<br/>
Yes, the Lord has ris’n today,<br/>
Yes, the Lord has ris’n today!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus triumphs! sing ye praises<br/>
By His death He overcame;<br/>
Thus the Lord His glory raises,<br/>
Thus He fills His foes with shame;<br/>
Sing ye praises, sing ye praises,<br/>
Praises to the Victor’s Name,<br/>
Praises to the Victor’s Name!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus triumphs! countless legions<br/>
Come from Heav’n to meet their King;<br/>
Soon, in yonder blessèd regions,<br/>
They shall join His praise to sing:<br/>
Songs eternal, songs eternal,<br/>
Shall through Heav’n’s high arches ring,<br/>
Shall through Heav’n’s high arches ring!<br/>
