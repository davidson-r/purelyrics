Christ, enthroned in highest heaven,<br/>
Hear us crying from the deep,<br/>
For the faithful ones departed,<br/>
For the souls of all that sleep;<br/>
As Thy kneeling Church entreateth,<br/>
Hearken, Shepherd of the sheep.<br/>
<br/>
King of Glory, hear our voices,<br/>
Grant Thy faithful rest, we pray;<br/>
We have sinned, and may not bide it,<br/>
If Thou mark our steps astray;<br/>
Yet we plead the saving Victim,<br/>
Which for them we bring today.<br/>
<br/>
That which Thou Thyself hast offered<br/>
To Thy Father, offer we;<br/>
Let it win for them a blessing,<br/>
Bless them, Jesu, set them free;<br/>
They are Thine, they wait in patience;<br/>
Merciful and gracious be.<br/>
<br/>
They are Thine, O take them quickly,<br/>
Thou their Hope, O raise them high;<br/>
Ever hoping, ever trusting,<br/>
Unto Thee they strive and cry;<br/>
Day and night, both morn and even,<br/>
Be, O Christ, their Guardian nigh.<br/>
<br/>
Let Thy plenteous loving-kindness,<br/>
On them, as we pray, be poured;<br/>
Let them through Thy boundless mercy,<br/>
From all evil be restored;<br/>
Hearken to the voices pleading<br/>
Of Thy Church, O gracious Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Hear and answer prayers devoutest,<br/>
Break, O Lord, each binding chain,<br/>
Dash the gates of death asunder,<br/>
Quell the devil and his train;<br/>
Bring the souls which Thou hast ransomed<br/>
Evermore in joy to reign.
