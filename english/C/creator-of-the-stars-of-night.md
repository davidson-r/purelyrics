Creator of the stars of night,<br/>
Thy people’s everlasting light,<br/>
Jesu, Redeemer, save us all,<br/>
And hear Thy servants when they call.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, grieving that the ancient curse<br/>
Should doom to death a universe,<br/>
Hast found the medicine, full of grace,<br/>
To save and heal a ruined race.<br/>
<br/>
Thou cam’st, the Bridegroom of the bride,<br/>
As drew the world to evening-tide;<br/>
Proceeding from a virgin shrine,<br/>
The spotless Victim all divine.<br/>
<br/>
At Whose dread Name, majestic now,<br/>
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;<br/>
And things celestial Thee shall own,<br/>
And things terrestrial, Lord alone.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou Whose coming is with dread<br/>
To judge and doom the quick and dead,<br/>
Preserve us, while we dwell below,<br/>
From every insult of the foe.<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father, God the Son,<br/>
And God the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
Laud, honor, might, and glory be<br/>
From age to age eternally.<br/>
