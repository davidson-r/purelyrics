<br/>
God is calling the prodigal, come without delay,<br/>
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee.<br/>
Tho’ you’ve wandered so far from His presence, come today,<br/>
Hear His loving voice calling still.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come;<br/>
Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come.<br/>
<br/>
Patient, loving and tenderly still the Father pleads,<br/>
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;<br/>
Oh! return while the Spirit in mercy intercedes,<br/>
Hear His loving voice calling still.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Come, there’s bread in the house of the Father, and to spare,<br/>
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;<br/>
Lo! the table is spread and the feast is waiting there,<br/>
Hear His loving voice calling still.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
