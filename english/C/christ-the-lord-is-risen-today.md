<br/>
Christ, the Lord, is risen today, Alleluia!<br/>
Sons of men and angels say, Alleluia!<br/>
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!<br/>
Sing, ye heavens, and earth, reply, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Love’s redeeming work is done, Alleluia!<br/>
Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!<br/>
Lo! the Sun’s eclipse is over, Alleluia!<br/>
Lo! He sets in blood no more, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Alleluia!<br/>
Christ hath burst the gates of hell, Alleluia!<br/>
Death in vain forbids His rise, Alleluia!<br/>
Christ hath opened paradise, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia!<br/>
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!<br/>
Once He died our souls to save, Alleluia!<br/>
Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Soar we now where Christ hath led, Alleluia!<br/>
Following our exalted Head, Alleluia!<br/>
Made like Him, like Him we rise, Alleluia!<br/>
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Hail, the Lord of earth and heaven, Alleluia!<br/>
Praise to Thee by both be given, Alleluia!<br/>
Thee we greet triumphant now, Alleluia!<br/>
Hail, the resurrection day, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
King of glory, Soul of bliss, Alleluia!<br/>
Everlasting life is this, Alleluia!<br/>
Thee to know, Thy power to prove, Alleluia!<br/>
Thus to sing and thus to love, Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia!<br/>
Unto Christ, our heavenly King, Alleluia!<br/>
Who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia!<br/>
Sinners to redeem and save. Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
But the pains that He endured, Alleluia!<br/>
Our salvation have procured, Alleluia!<br/>
Now above the sky He’s King, Alleluia!<br/>
Where the angels ever sing. Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!<br/>
Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!<br/>
Who did once upon the cross, Alleluia!<br/>
Suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia!<br/>
