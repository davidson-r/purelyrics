<br/>
Christian, rise and act thy creed;<br/>
Let thy prayer be in thy deed;<br/>
Seek the right, perform the true,<br/>
Raise thy works and life anew.<br/>
<br/>
Hearts around thee sink with care;<br/>
Thou canst help their load to bear;<br/>
Thou canst bring inspiring light,<br/>
Arm their faltering wills to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Let thine aims be hope and joy,<br/>
And thy worship Godâ€™s employ;<br/>
Give Him thanks in humble zeal,<br/>
Learning all His will to feel.<br/>
<br/>
Come, then law divine, and reign;<br/>
Freest faith assailed in vain,<br/>
Perfect love bereft of fear,<br/>
Born in heaven and radiant here.<br/>
