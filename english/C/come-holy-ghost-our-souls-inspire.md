<br/>
Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,<br/>
And lighten with celestial fire;<br/>
Thou the anointing Spirit art,<br/>
Who dost Thy sev’nfold gifts impart.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Praise to Thy eternal merit,<br/>
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Thy blessèd unction from above<br/>
Is comfort, life, and fire of love;<br/>
Enable with perpetual light<br/>
The dullness of our blinded sight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Anoint and cheer our soilèd face<br/>
With the abundance of Thy grace;<br/>
Keep far our foes, give peace at home;<br/>
Where Thou art Guide, no ill can come.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Teach us to know the Father, Son,<br/>
And Thee, of both, to be but One;<br/>
That through the ages all along<br/>
This, this may be our endless song.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
