title: Come Every Pious Heart

<center>
Come, every pious heart,<br/>
That loves the Savior’s Name,<br/>
Your noblest powers exert<br/>
To celebrate His fame;<br/>
Tell all above, and all below;<br/>
That debt of love to Him you owe.<br/>
<br/>
From the dark grave He rose;<br/>
The mansions of the dead,<br/>
And thence His mighty foes<br/>
In glorious triumph led;<br/>
Up through the sky the Conqueror rode;<br/>
And reigns on High, the Savior God.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, we ne’er can pay<br/>
The debt we owe Thy love;<br/>
Yet tell us how we may<br/>
Our gratitude approve;<br/>
Our hearts, our all to Thee we give;<br/>
The gift, though small, Thou wilt receive.
