<br/>
Come, your hearts and voices raising,<br/>
Christ the Lord with gladness praising;<br/>
Loudly sing His love amazing,<br/>
Worthy folk of Christendom.<br/>
<br/>
Sin and death may well be groaning,<br/>
Satan now may well be moaning;<br/>
We, our full salvation owning,<br/>
Cast our every care away.<br/>
<br/>
See how God, for us providing,<br/>
Gave His Son and life abiding;<br/>
He our weary steps is guiding<br/>
From earth’s woes to heav’nly joy.<br/>
<br/>
Christ, from Heaven to us descending<br/>
And in love our race befriending,<br/>
In our need His help extending,<br/>
Saved us from the wily foe.<br/>
<br/>
Jacob’s Star in all its splendor<br/>
Beams with comfort sweet and tender,<br/>
Forcing Satan to surrender,<br/>
Breaking all the powers of hell.<br/>
<br/>
From the bondage that oppressed us,<br/>
From sin’s fetters that possessed us,<br/>
From the grief that sore distressed us,<br/>
We, the captives, now are free.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the joy beyond expressing<br/>
When by faith we grasp this blessing<br/>
And to Thee we come confessing<br/>
That our freedom Thou hast wrought!<br/>
<br/>
Gracious Child, we pray Thee, hear us,<br/>
From Thy lowly manger cheer us,<br/>
Gently lead us and be near us<br/>
Till we join th’angelic choir.<br/>
