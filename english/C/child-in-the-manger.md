<br/>
Child in the manger, Infant of Mary,<br/>
Outcast and Stranger, Lord of all,<br/>
Child Who inherits all our transgressions,<br/>
All our demerits on Him fall.<br/>
<br/>
Once the most holy Child of salvation<br/>
Gently and lowly lived below.<br/>
Now as our glorious mighty Redeemer,<br/>
See Him victorious oâ€™er each foe.<br/>
<br/>
Prophets foretold Him, Infant of wonder;<br/>
Angels behold Him on His throne.<br/>
Worthy our Savior of all our praises;<br/>
Happy forever are His own.<br/>
