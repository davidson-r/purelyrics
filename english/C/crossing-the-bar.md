title: Crossing The Bar

<center>
Sunset and evening star,<br/>
And one clear call for me!<br/>
And may there be no moaning of the bar<br/>
When I put out to sea.<br/>
<br/>
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br/>
Too full for sound and foam.<br/>
When that which drew from the boundless deep<br/>
Turns again home.<br/>
<br/>
Twilight and evening bell,<br/>
And after that the dark!<br/>
And may there be no sadness of farewell<br/>
When I embark.<br/>
<br/>
For, though from out our bourne of time and place<br/>
The flood may bear me far,<br/>
I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br/>
When I have crossed the bar.
