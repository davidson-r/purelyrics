title: Come Thou Redeemer of the Earth

<center>
Come, Thou Redeemer of the earth,<br/>
And manifest Thy virgin birth:<br/>
Let every age adoring fall;<br/>
Such birth befits the God of all.<br/>
<br/>
Begotten of no human will,<br/>
But of the Spirit, Thou art still<br/>
The Word of God in flesh arrayed,<br/>
The promised Fruit to man displayed.<br/>
<br/>
The virgin womb that burden gained<br/>
With virgin honor all unstained;<br/>
The banners there of virtue glow;<br/>
God in His temple dwells below.<br/>
<br/>
Forth from His chamber goeth He,<br/>
That royal home of purity,<br/>
A giant in twofold substance one,<br/>
Rejoicing now His course to run.<br/>
<br/>
From God the Father He proceeds,<br/>
To God the Father back He speeds;<br/>
His course He runs to death and hell,<br/>
Returning on Godâ€™s throne to dwell.<br/>
<br/>
O equal to the Father, Thou!<br/>
Gird on Thy fleshly mantle now;<br/>
The weakness of our mortal state<br/>
With deathless might invigorate.<br/>
<br/>
Thy cradle here shall glitter bright,<br/>
And darkness breathe a newer light,<br/>
Where endless faith shall shine serene,<br/>
And twilight never intervene.<br/>
<br/>
All laud to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To God the Holy Paraclete.
