<br/>
Come, children, learn to fear the Lord<br/>
And that your days be long,<br/>
Let not a false or spiteful word<br/>
Be found upon your tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Depart from mischief, practice love,<br/>
Pursue the works of peace;<br/>
So shall the Lord your ways approve,<br/>
And set your souls at ease.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes awake to guard the just,<br/>
His ears attend their cry;<br/>
When broken spirits dwell in dust,<br/>
The God of grace is nigh.<br/>
<br/>
What though the sorrows here they taste<br/>
Are sharp and tedious too,<br/>
The Lord, Who saves them all at last,<br/>
Is their supporter now.<br/>
<br/>
Evil shall smite the wicked dead;<br/>
But God secures His own,<br/>
Prevents the mischief when they slide,<br/>
Or heals the broken bone.<br/>
<br/>
When desolation, like a flood,<br/>
Oâ€™er the proud sinner rolls,<br/>
Saints find a refuge in their God,<br/>
For He redeemed their souls.<br/>
