title: Come Children Raise Your Voices

<br/>
Come, children; raise your voices!<br/>
The King of Love comes from above,<br/>
The heavenly host rejoices.<br/>
<br/>
The Babe lies in the manger;<br/>
God seeks His own, by angels known,<br/>
But unto men a Stranger.<br/>
<br/>
Though weak and helpless lying,<br/>
From Him is giv’n through earth and Heav’n<br/>
New life, and peace undying.<br/>
<br/>
But who on earth do greet Him?<br/>
A shepherd band with staff in hand<br/>
Sets forth by night to meet Him.<br/>
<br/>
And lo! from eastward riding<br/>
The wise men three; the star they see,<br/>
And follow it confiding.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Hope of all the ages!<br/>
May we find grace to claim our place<br/>
Where shepherds kneel and sages.<br/>
