Christ the Lord is risen again;<br/>
Christ hath broken every chain;<br/>
Hark! Angelic voices cry,<br/>
Singing evermore on high,<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
He, Who gave for us His life,<br/>
Who for us endured the strife,<br/>
Is our Paschal Lamb today;<br/>
We, too, sing for joy, and say<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
He, Who bore all pain and loss<br/>
Comfortless upon the cross,<br/>
Lives in glory now on high,<br/>
Pleads for us, and hears our cry;<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
He Who slumbered in the grave,<br/>
Is exalted now to save;<br/>
Now through Christendom it rings<br/>
That the Lamb is King of kings.<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
He Whose path no records tell,<br/>
Who descended into hell;<br/>
Who the strong man armed hath bound,<br/>
Now in highest heaven is crowned.<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Now He bids tell abroad<br/>
How the lost may be restored,<br/>
How the penitent forgiven,<br/>
How we, too, may enter Heavâ€™n.<br/>
Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Thou, our Paschal Lamb indeed,<br/>
Christ, Thy ransomed people feed:<br/>
Take our sins and guilt away,<br/>
Let us sing by night and day<br/>
Alleluia!
