<br/>
Come, sing with holy gladness,<br/>
High alleluias sing,<br/>
Uplift your loud hosannas<br/>
To Jesus, Lord and King;<br/>
Sing, boys in joyful chorus<br/>
Your hymn of praise today,<br/>
And sing, ye gentle maidens,<br/>
Your sweet responsive lay.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis good for boys and maidens<br/>
Sweet hymns to Christ to sing,<br/>
’Tis meet that children’s voices<br/>
Should praise the children’s King:<br/>
For Jesus is salvation,<br/>
And glory, grace and rest;<br/>
To babe and boy and maiden<br/>
The one Redeemer blest.<br/>
<br/>
O boys, be strong in Jesus,<br/>
To toil for him is gain,<br/>
And Jesus wrought with Joseph<br/>
With chisel, saw and plane;<br/>
O maidens, live for Jesus,<br/>
Who was a maiden’s Son;<br/>
Be patient, pure and gentle,<br/>
And perfect grace begun.<br/>
<br/>
Soon in the golden city<br/>
The boys and girls shall play,<br/>
And through the dazzling mansions<br/>
Rejoice in endless day;<br/>
O Christ, prepare Thy children<br/>
With that triumphant throng<br/>
To pass the burnished portals,<br/>
And sing th’eternal song.<br/>
