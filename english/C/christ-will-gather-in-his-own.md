<br/>
Christ will gather in His own<br/>
To the place where He is gone,<br/>
Where their heart and treasure lie,<br/>
Where our life is hid on high.<br/>
<br/>
Day by day the voice saith, “Come,<br/>
Enter thine eternal home”;<br/>
Asking not if we can spare<br/>
This dear soul it summons there.<br/>
<br/>
Had He asked us, well we know<br/>
We should cry, “O spare this blow!”<br/>
Yes, with streaming tears should pray,<br/>
“Lord, we love him, let him stay.”<br/>
[substitute her if appropriate]<br/>
<br/>
But the Lord doth naught amiss,<br/>
And, since He hath ordered this,<br/>
We have naught to do but still<br/>
Rest in silence on His will.<br/>
<br/>
Many a heart no longer here,<br/>
Ah! was all too inly dear,<br/>
Yet, O Love, ’tis Thou dost call,<br/>
Thou wilt be our All in all.<br/>
