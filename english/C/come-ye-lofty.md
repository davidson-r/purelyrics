<br/>
Come ye lofty, come ye lowly<br/>
Let your songs of gladness ring;<br/>
In a stable lies the Holy,<br/>
In a manger rests the King:<br/>
See in Mary’s arms reposing<br/>
Christ by highest heaven adored:<br/>
Come, your circle round Him closing,<br/>
Pious hearts that love the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Come ye poor, no pomp of station<br/>
Robes the Child your hearts adore:<br/>
He, the Lord of all salvation,<br/>
Shares your want, is weak and poor:<br/>
Oxen, round about behold them;<br/>
Rafters naked, cold, and bare,<br/>
See the Shepherds, God has told them<br/>
That the Prince of Life lies there.<br/>
<br/>
Come ye children blithe and merry,<br/>
This one Child your model make;<br/>
Christmas holly, leaf, and berry,<br/>
All be prized for His dear sake:<br/>
Come ye gentle hearts and tender,<br/>
Come ye spirits keen and bold;<br/>
All in all your homage render,<br/>
Weak and mighty, young and old.<br/>
<br/>
High above a star is shining,<br/>
And the wise men haste from far:<br/>
Come glad hearts, and spirits pining –<br/>
For you all has risen the star.<br/>
Let us bring our poor oblations,<br/>
Thanks and love, and faith and praise;<br/>
Come ye people, come ye nations,<br/>
All in all draw nigh to gaze.<br/>
<br/>
Hark the Heaven of heavens is ringing:<br/>
Christ the Lord to man is born!<br/>
Are not all our hearts too singing,<br/>
Welcome, welcome, Christmas morn?<br/>
Still the Child, all power possessing,<br/>
Smiles as through the ages past;<br/>
And the song of Christmas blessing<br/>
Sweetly sinks to rest at last.<br/>
