<center>
Christians, sing out with exultation,<br/>
And praise your Benefactor’s Name!<br/>
Today the Author of salvation,<br/>
The Father’s well belovèd came.<br/>
Of undefilèd virgin mother<br/>
An Infant, all divine, was born,<br/>
And God Himself became your Brother<br/>
Upon this happy Christmas morn.<br/>
<br/>
In Him eternal might and power<br/>
To human weakness hath inclined;<br/>
And this poor Child brings richest dower<br/>
Of gifts and graces to mankind.<br/>
While here His Majesty disguising,<br/>
A servant’s form the Master wears,<br/>
Behold the beams of glory rising,<br/>
E’en from His poverty and tears.<br/>
<br/>
A stable serves Him for a dwelling,<br/>
And for a bed a manger mean;<br/>
Yet o’er His head, His advent telling,<br/>
A new and wondrous star is seen.<br/>
Angels rehearse to men the story,<br/>
The joyful story of His birth;<br/>
To Him they raise the anthem “Glory<br/>
To God on high, and peace on earth!”<br/>
<br/>
For through this holy Incarnation<br/>
The primal curse is done away;<br/>
And blessèd peace o’er all creation<br/>
Hath shed its pure and gentle ray.<br/>
Then, in that heavenly concert joining,<br/>
O Christian men, with one accord,<br/>
Your voices tunefully combining,<br/>
Salute the birthday of your Lord!
