<br/>
Come, Holy Spirit, Dove divine,<br/>
On these baptismal waters shine,<br/>
And teach our hearts, in highest strain,<br/>
To praise the Lamb for sinners slain.<br/>
<br/>
We love Your Name, we love Your laws,<br/>
And joyfully embrace Your cause;<br/>
We love Your cross, the shame, the pain,<br/>
O Lamb of God, for sinners slain.<br/>
<br/>
We sink beneath the waterâ€™s face,<br/>
And thank You for Your saving grace;<br/>
We die to sin and seek a grave<br/>
With You, beneath the yielding wave.<br/>
<br/>
And as we rise with You to live,<br/>
O let the Holy Spirit give<br/>
The sealing unction from above,<br/>
The joy of life, the fire of love.<br/>
