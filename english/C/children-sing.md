<br/>
Children sing, gladly sing,<br/>
Hallelujahs to our King;<br/>
Lord of all, great and small,<br/>
At His feet with rapture fall;<br/>
Children sing, He is near,<br/>
Bending still His gracious ear;<br/>
Trust in Him, O rejoice!<br/>
Praise the Lord with heart and voice.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then sing, gladly sing.<br/>
Sing, gladly sing.<br/>
Till the heav’nly arches ring,<br/>
Till you hear the saints above,<br/>
Praising God, for He is love.<br/>
<br/>
Journey on hand in hand,<br/>
Singing to the promised land,<br/>
There is rest, there is rest,<br/>
In the kingdom of the blest;<br/>
Children sing, gladly sing,<br/>
Till the heav’nly arches ring,<br/>
Till you hear saints above,<br/>
Praising God, for He is love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Children sing, when the light<br/>
Wakes the rosy morning bright,<br/>
When the birds’ tuneful lay,<br/>
Hails with joy the op’ning day,<br/>
Praise the Lord, He has made<br/>
Verdant lawn and forest shade.<br/>
Children sing, gladly sing,<br/>
Hallelujahs to our King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Children sing! who can tell<br/>
If the song you love so well,<br/>
May not reach one whose heart<br/>
Longs to choose the better part?<br/>
Stealing soft, like the sigh<br/>
Of a zephyr passing by,<br/>
Children sing, ever sing,<br/>
Loudest praise to God our King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
