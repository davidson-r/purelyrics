<br/>
Creator Spirit, by Whose aid<br/>
The world’s foundations first were laid,<br/>
Come, visit every pious mind;<br/>
Come, pour Thy joys on human kind;<br/>
From sin, and sorrow set us free;<br/>
And make Thy temples worthy Thee.<br/>
<br/>
O, Source of uncreated Light,<br/>
The Father’s promised Paraclete!<br/>
Thrice holy Fount, thrice holy Fire,<br/>
Our hearts with heav’nly love inspire;<br/>
Come, and Thy sacred unction bring<br/>
To sanctify us, while we sing!<br/>
<br/>
Plenteous of grace, descend from high,<br/>
Rich in Thy sev’nfold energy!<br/>
Thou strength of His almighty hand,<br/>
Whose pow’r does Heav’n and earth command:<br/>
Proceeding Spirit, our Defense,<br/>
Who dost the gift of tongues dispense,<br/>
And crown’st Thy gift with eloquence!<br/>
<br/>
Refine and purge our earthly parts;<br/>
But, oh, inflame and fire our hearts!<br/>
Our frailties help, our vice control;<br/>
Submit the senses to the soul;<br/>
And when rebellious they are grown,<br/>
Then, lay Thy hand, and hold them down.<br/>
<br/>
Chase from our minds th’infernal foe;<br/>
And peace, the fruit of love, bestow;<br/>
And, lest our feet should step astray,<br/>
Protect, and guide us in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Make us eternal truths receive,<br/>
And practice, all that we believe:<br/>
Give us Thyself, that we may see<br/>
The Father and the Son, by Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Immortal honor, endless fame,<br/>
Attend th’almighty Father’s Name:<br/>
The Savior Son be glorified,<br/>
Who for lost man’s redemption died:<br/>
And equal adoration be,<br/>
Eternal Paraclete, to Thee.<br/>
