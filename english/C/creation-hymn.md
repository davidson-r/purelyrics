<br/>
Then there was neither Aught nor Nought, no air nor sky beyond.<br/>
What covered all? Where rested all? In watery gulf profound?<br/>
Nor death was then, nor deathlessness, nor change of night and day.<br/>
That One breathed calmly, self-sustained; nought else beyond it lay.<br/>
<br/>
Gloom hid in gloom existed first - one sea, eluding view.<br/>
That One, a void in chaos wrapt, by inward fervour grew.<br/>
Within it first arose desire, the primal germ of mind,<br/>
Which nothing with existence links, as sages searching find.<br/>
<br/>
The kindling ray that shot across the dark and drear abyss-<br/>
Was it beneath? or high aloft? What bard can answer this?<br/>
There fecundating powers were found, and mighty forces strove-<br/>
A self-supporting mass beneath, and energy above.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, who ever told, from whence this vast creation rose?<br/>
No gods had then been born - who then can e'er the truth disclose?<br/>
Whence sprang this world, and whether framed by hand divine or no-<br/>
Its lord in heaven alone can tell, if even he can show.<br/>
