<br/>
Come to a wedding,<br/>
Come to a blessing,<br/>
Come on a day when happiness sings!<br/>
Come rain or sun,<br/>
Come winter or summer,<br/>
Celebrate love and all that it brings.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the love,<br/>
That holds us together,<br/>
Parent and child, and lover and friend;<br/>
Thanks to the God,<br/>
Whose love is our centre,<br/>
Source of compassion, knowing no end.<br/>
<br/>
Love is the gift,<br/>
And love is the giver,<br/>
Love is the gold that<br/>
Makes the day shine;<br/>
Love forgets self to care for the other,<br/>
Love changes life from water to wine.<br/>
<br/>
Come to this wedding,<br/>
Asking a blessing,<br/>
For all the years that living will prove;<br/>
Health of the body,<br/>
Health of the spirit,<br/>
Now to you both we offer our love.<br/>
