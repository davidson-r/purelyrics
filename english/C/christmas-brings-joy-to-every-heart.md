Christmas brings joy to every heart,<br/>
Sets old and young rejoicing,<br/>
What angels sang once to all on earth,<br/>
Oh, hear the children voicing.<br/>
Bright is the tree with lights aglow,<br/>
Like birds that perch together,<br/>
The child that holdeth Christmas dear<br/>
Shall keep these joys forever.<br/>
<br/>
Joy comes to the all the world today,<br/>
To halls and cottage hasting,<br/>
Come, sparrow and dove, from roof tree tall,<br/>
And share our Christmas feasting.<br/>
Dance, little child, on mother’s knee,<br/>
The lovely day is dawning,<br/>
The road to paradise is found<br/>
The blessèd Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
Once to this earth our Savior came,<br/>
An infant poor and lowly,<br/>
To open for us those gardens fair<br/>
Where dwell His angels holy.<br/>
Christmas joy He bringeth us,<br/>
The Christ child King of heaven,<br/>
“To every little child,” He saith,<br/>
“Shall angel wings be given.”
