<br/>
Come, gracious Spirit, heav'nly Dove,<br/>
With light and comfort from above;<br/>
Be Thou our Guardian, Thou our Guide;<br/>
O'er every tho't and step preside. <br/>
<br/>
The light of truth to us display,<br/>
And make us know and choose Thy way;<br/>
Plant holy fear in every heart,<br/>
That we from God may ne'er depart. <br/>
<br/>
Lead us to holiness, the road<br/>
Which we must take to dwell with God;<br/>
Lead us to Christ, the living Way,<br/>
Nor let us from His presence stray. <br/>
<br/>
Lead us to God, our final rest,<br/>
To be with Him forever blest;<br/>
Lead us to heav'n, that we may share<br/>
Fullness of joy forever there. <br/>
