<center>
Awake from your slumber! Arise from your sleep!<br/>
A new day is dawning for all those who weep.<br/>
The people in darkness have seen a great light.<br/>
The Lord of our longing has conquered the night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain: Let us build the city of God.<br/>
May our tears be turned into dancing.<br/>
For the Lord our light and our love has turned the night into day.<br/>
<br/>
We are sons of the morning; we are daughters of day.<br/>
The One who has loved us has brightened our way.<br/>
The Lord of all kindness has called us to be<br/>
a light for all people to set their hearts free.<br/>
<br/>
God is light; in God there is no darkness.<br/>
Let us walk in the light. God's children one and all.<br/>
O comfort my people make gentle your words,<br/>
proclaim to my city the day of her birth.<br/>
<br/>
O city of gladness now lift up your voice,<br/>
proclaim the good tidings that all may rejoice.
