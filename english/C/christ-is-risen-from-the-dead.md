<br/>
Christ is risen from the dead!<br/>
Darkness now no more shall reign;<br/>
Thorns no more shall crown the head<br/>
That was bowed with grief and pain:<br/>
Christ the Lord, the mighty King,<br/>
From our sin hath made us free.<br/>
Where, O death, is now thy sting?<br/>
Where, O grave, thy victory?<br/>
<br/>
Scoffers now no more will say:<br/>
If Thou be the Christ, come down<br/>
From the cross, and prove today<br/>
That to Thee belongs the crown!<br/>
For our risen Lord and King<br/>
From our sin hath made us free,<br/>
Where, O death, is now thy sting?<br/>
Where, O grave, thy victory?<br/>
<br/>
Faith now knows He is the Lord,<br/>
Gives assent to His decree,<br/>
Trusts the promise in His Word,<br/>
And is crowned with victory,<br/>
Shouting praises to the King,<br/>
Who from sin hath made us free.<br/>
Where, O death, is now thy sting?<br/>
Where, O grave, thy victory?<br/>
