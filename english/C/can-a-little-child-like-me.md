<br/>
Can a little child like me<br/>
Thank the Father fittingly?<br/>
Yes, oh yes! be good and true,<br/>
Faithful, kind, in all you do;<br/>
Love the Lord, and do your part;<br/>
Learn to say with all your heart,<br/>
<br/>
Father, we thank Thee,<br/>
Father, we thank Thee,<br/>
Father in Heaven, we thank Thee.<br/>
<br/>
For the fruit upon the tree<br/>
For the birds that sing of Thee,<br/>
For the earth in beauty dressed,<br/>
Father, mother, and the rest,<br/>
For Thy precious, loving care,<br/>
For Thy bounty everywhere,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For the sunshine warm and bright,<br/>
For the day and for the night,<br/>
For the lessons of our youthâ€”<br/>
Honor, gratitude and truth,<br/>
For the love that met us here,<br/>
For the home and for the cheer,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
For our comrades and our plays,<br/>
And our happy holidays,<br/>
For the joyful work and true<br/>
That a little child might do,<br/>
For our lives but just begun,<br/>
For the great gift of Thy Son,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
