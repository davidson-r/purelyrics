title: Come Let Us Join Our Friends Above

<br/>
Come, let us join our friends above, who have obtained the prize,<br/>
And on the eagle wings of love to joys celestial rise.<br/>
Let saints on earth unite to sing with those to glory gone,<br/>
For all the servants of our King in earth and heaven are one.<br/>
<br/>
One family we dwell in Him, one church above, beneath,<br/>
Though now divided by the stream, the narrow stream of death;<br/>
One army of the living God, to His command we bow;<br/>
Part of His host have crossed the flood, and part are crossing now.<br/>
<br/>
Ten thousand to their endless home this solemn moment fly,<br/>
And we are to the margin come, and we expect to die.<br/>
His militant embodied host, with wishful looks we stand,<br/>
And long to see that happy coast, and reach the heavenly land.<br/>
<br/>
Our old companions in distress we haste again to see,<br/>
And eager long for our release, and full felicity:<br/>
Even now by faith we join our hands with those that went before;<br/>
And greet the blood besprinkled bands on the eternal shore.<br/>
<br/>
Our spirits too shall quickly join, like theirs with glory crowned,<br/>
And shout to see our Captainâ€™s sign, to hear His trumpet sound.<br/>
O that we now might grasp our Guide! O that the word were given!<br/>
Come, Lord of Hosts, the waves divide, and land us all in Heaven.<br/>
