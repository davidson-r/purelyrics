Children of Jerusalem<br/>
Sang the praise of Jesus’ Name:<br/>
Children, too, of modern days<br/>
Join to sing the Savior’s praise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hark, hark, hark!<br/>
While infant voices sing,<br/>
Hark, hark, hark!<br/>
While infant voices sing<br/>
Loud hosannas, loud hosannas,<br/>
Loud hosannas to our King.<br/>
<br/>
We are taught to love the Lord,<br/>
We are taught to read His Word;<br/>
We are taught the way to Heav’n:<br/>
Praise for all to God be giv’n.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Parents, teachers, old and young,<br/>
All unite to swell the song;<br/>
Higher and yet higher rise,<br/>
’Til hosannas fill the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
