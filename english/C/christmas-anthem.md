title: Christmas Anthem

<center>
Hear what glorious song of angels<br/>
Is now ringing through the air;<br/>
Never valley, never mountain<br/>
Heard an anthem half so fair.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
Is the jubilant refrain;<br/>
God is sending us a Savior,<br/>
Peace on earth, good will to man.<br/>
<br/>
Messengers of God’s free mercy<br/>
Are now seen by human eye;<br/>
Shepherds hear the wondrous message:<br/>
“Glory be to God on high.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Let us also sing the praises<br/>
Of our God so full of love,<br/>
Who on Christmas sent a Savior,<br/>
Sent a Savior from above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
