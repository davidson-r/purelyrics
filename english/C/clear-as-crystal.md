<br/>
Clear as crystal flows the river<br/>
From the throne of God above;<br/>
’Tis the water pure, of eternal life,<br/>
From the Fount of endless love.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Clear as crystal, clear as crystal<br/>
May Thy truth forever be;<br/>
Clear as crystal, clear as crystal<br/>
In our hearts, O Lord, from Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Clear as crystal, like a jasper,<br/>
Is the heav’nly city’s light,<br/>
As the wall appears, and the pearly gates—<br/>
To the pilgrim’s ravished sight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Clear as crystal, like the wondrous<br/>
Sea of glass before the throne,<br/>
Where the joyful cry rises day and night<br/>
To the glorious Three in One.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
