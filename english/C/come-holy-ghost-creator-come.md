<br/>
Come, Holy Ghost, Creator, come,<br/>
From thy bright heav’nly throne,<br/>
Come take possession of our souls,<br/>
And make them all thy own.<br/>
<br/>
Thou who art called the Paraclete,<br/>
Best gift of God above,<br/>
The living spring, the living fire,<br/>
Sweet unction and true love.<br/>
<br/>
Thou who art sevenfold in thy grace,<br/>
Finger of God’s right hand<br/>
His promise teaching little ones<br/>
To speak an understand.<br/>
<br/>
O guide our minds with thy blessed light,<br/>
With love our hearts inflame;<br/>
And with thy strength, which never decays<br/>
Confirm our mortal frame.<br/>
<br/>
Far from us drive our deadly foe;<br/>
True peach unto us bring;<br/>
And through all perils lead us safe<br/>
Beneath thy sacred wing.<br/>
<br/>
Through thee may we the Father know,<br/>
Through thee the eternal Son,<br/>
And thee, the Spirit of them both,<br/>
Thrice-blessed Three in One.<br/>
<br/>
All glory to the Father be,<br/>
With his coequal Son;<br/>
The same to thee, great Paraclete,<br/>
While endless ages run. <br/>
<br/>
Amen.<br/>
