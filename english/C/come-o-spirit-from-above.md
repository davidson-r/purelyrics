<br/>
Come O spirit from above<br/>
come from your celestial heights<br/>
come with Your blessed light so radiant bright.<br/>
<br/>
Come O Savior of the poor,<br/>
come O source of gifts ensured<br/>
come with Your gentle hope,<br/>
so wondrous and pure.<br/>
<br/>
In our labor, rest most sweet;<br/>
grateful coolness in the heat.<br/>
Console our restless lives,<br/>
by Your comfort, we seek.<br/>
<br/>
Bend the stubborn heart and will,<br/>
melt the frozen, warm the chill.<br/>
Come guide our searching minds<br/>
toward Your promise fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us virtue's sure reward,<br/>
may Your gracious love be sent.<br/>
Come with Your peace and joy that shall never end. <br/>
