title: Come all ye Shepherds

<center>
Come, all ye shepherds, ye children of earth,<br/>
Come ye, bring greetings to yon heavenly birth.<br/>
For Christ the Lord to all men is given,<br/>
To be our Savior sent down from heaven:<br/>
Come, welcome Him!<br/>
<br/>
Hasten then, hasten to Bethlehem’s stall,<br/>
There to see heaven descend to us all.<br/>
With holy feeling, there humbly kneeling,<br/>
We will adore Him, bow down before Him,<br/>
Worship the King.<br/>
<br/>
Angels and shepherds together we go<br/>
Seeking the Savior from all earthly woe;<br/>
While angels, winging, His praise are singing,<br/>
Heaven’s echoes ringing, peace on earth bringing,<br/>
Good will to men.
