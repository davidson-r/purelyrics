<br/>
Christians, carol sweetly, up today and sing!<br/>
â€™Tis the happy birthday of our holy King:<br/>
Haste we then to greet Him, humbly falling down,<br/>
While our hands entwine Him, dearest Babe, a crown.<br/>
<br/>
Crowds of snow-white angels throng the golden stair;<br/>
All things are delightful, all things passing fair;<br/>
Bells, clear music making, peal the news to earth;<br/>
Chimes within make answer, all is glee and mirth.<br/>
<br/>
Michael, at the manger, bows his royal face;<br/>
Gabriel, with lily, hides transcendent grace:<br/>
For, dear friends, the glory of that lowly bed<br/>
Overpowers the beauty on archangels shed.<br/>
<br/>
Shall I tell of Joseph, who, with rapt surprise,<br/>
Sees the light from Godhead fill those infant eyes?<br/>
Shall I sing of Mary, who, upon her breast,<br/>
Cradles her Creator, soothes Him to His rest?<br/>
<br/>
Angels, Mary, Joseph, yes, I greet you all!<br/>
Falling down in worship at the manger stall!<br/>
For you hail our Monarch, born a Child today;<br/>
So with you I worship and my homage pay.<br/>
