<center>
<br/>
When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,<br/>
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,<br/>
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,<br/>
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br/>
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br/>
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br/>
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.<br/>
<br/>
Are you ever burdened with a load of care?<br/>
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?<br/>
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,<br/>
And you will keep singing as the days go by.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When you look at others with their lands and gold,<br/>
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;<br/>
Count your many blessings. Wealth can never buy<br/>
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So, amid the conflict whether great or small,<br/>
Do not be disheartened, God is over all;<br/>
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,<br/>
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
