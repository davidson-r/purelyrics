<br/>
Christ, Who once among us as a Child did dwell,<br/>
Is the childrenâ€™s Savior, and He loves us well;<br/>
If we keep our promise made Him at the font,<br/>
He will be our Shepherd, and we shall not want.<br/>
<br/>
There it was they laid us in those tender arms,<br/>
Where the lambs are carried safe from all alarms;<br/>
If we trust His promise, He will let us rest<br/>
In His arms forever, leaning on His breast.<br/>
<br/>
Though we may not see Him for a little while,<br/>
We shall know He holds us, often feel His smile;<br/>
Death will be to slumber, in that sweet embrace,<br/>
And we shall awaken to behold His face.<br/>
<br/>
He will be our Shepherd after as before,<br/>
By still heavenly waters lead us evermore,<br/>
Make us lie in pastures beautiful and green,<br/>
Where none thirst or hunger,<br/>
And no tears are seen.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, our good Shepherd, laying down Thy life,<br/>
Lest Thy sheep should perish in the cruel strife,<br/>
Help us to remember all Thy love and care,<br/>
Trust in Thee, and love Thee<br/>
Always, everywhere.<br/>
