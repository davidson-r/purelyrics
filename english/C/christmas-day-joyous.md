Christmas day joyous, feast of all peoples<br/>
Heaven and earth resound with glad praise.<br/>
Angels descending sing forth His glory<br/>
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days<br/>
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days.<br/>
<br/>
Bethlehem’s star with radiance beaming<br/>
Fills human hearts with heavenly mirth,<br/>
God’s loving message brings new assurance<br/>
So let the world proclaim Jesus’ birth<br/>
So let the world proclaim Jesus’ birth.<br/>
<br/>
In adoration widows and orphans,<br/>
Whose hearts are burdened, turn unto Heav’n,<br/>
In faith and hope and love they can pray now<br/>
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv’n<br/>
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv’n.<br/>
<br/>
Joy we behold on earth and in Heaven<br/>
Wonderful Yuletide, blessings from Him,<br/>
Joy everlasting gladden all hearts now<br/>
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men<br/>
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men.
