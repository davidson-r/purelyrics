title: Come Ye Faithful Raise The Strain

<center>
Come, ye faithful, raise the strain of triumphant gladness;<br/>
God hath brought forth Israel into joy from sadness;<br/>
Loosed from Pharaoh’s bitter yoke Jacob’s sons and daughters,<br/>
Led them with unmoistened foot through the Red Sea waters.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis the spring of souls today; Christ has burst His prison,<br/>
And from three days’ sleep in death as a sun hath risen;<br/>
All the winter of our sins, long and dark, is flying<br/>
From His light, to Whom we give laud and praise undying.<br/>
<br/>
Now the queen of seasons, bright with the day of splendor,<br/>
With the royal feast of feasts, comes its joy to render;<br/>
Comes to glad Jerusalem, who with true affection<br/>
Welcomes in unwearied strains Jesus’ resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
Neither might the gates of death, nor the tomb’s dark portal,<br/>
Nor the watchers, nor the seal hold Thee as a mortal;<br/>
But today amidst the twelve Thou didst stand, bestowing<br/>
That Thy peace which evermore passeth human knowing.<br/>
<br/>
“Alleluia!” now we cry to our King immortal,<br/>
Who, triumphant, burst the bars of the tomb’s dark portal;<br/>
“Alleluia!” with the Son, God the Father praising,<br/>
“Alleluia!” yet again to the Spirit raising.
