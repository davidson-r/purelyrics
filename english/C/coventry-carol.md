Lullay, Thou little tiny Child,<br/>
By, by, lully, lullay.<br/>
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child.<br/>
By, by, lully, lullay.<br/>
<br/>
O sisters, too, how may we do,<br/>
For to preserve this day;<br/>
This poor Youngling for whom we sing,<br/>
By, by, lully, lullay.<br/>
<br/>
Herod the King, in his raging,<br/>
Charged he hath this day;<br/>
His men of might, in his own sight,<br/>
All children young, to slay.<br/>
<br/>
Then woe is me, poor Child, for Thee,<br/>
And ever mourn and say;<br/>
For Thy parting, nor say nor sing,<br/>
By, by, lully, lullay.
