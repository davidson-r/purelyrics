<br/>
Come down, O love divine, seek Thou this soul of mine,<br/>
And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing.<br/>
O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear,<br/>
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.<br/>
<br/>
O let it freely burn, til earthly passions turn<br/>
To dust and ashes in its heat consuming;<br/>
And let Thy glorious light shine ever on my sight,<br/>
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.<br/>
<br/>
Let holy charity mine outward vesture be,<br/>
And lowliness become mine inner clothing;<br/>
True lowliness of heart, which takes the humbler part,<br/>
And o’er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.<br/>
<br/>
And so the yearning strong, with which the soul will long,<br/>
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;<br/>
For none can guess its grace, till he become the place<br/>
Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.<br/>
