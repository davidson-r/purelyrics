<br/>
Cling to the Bible, though all else be taken;<br/>
Lose not its precepts, so precious and pure;<br/>
Souls that are sleeping its tidings awaken;<br/>
Life from the dead in its promises sure.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Cling to the Bible!<br/>
Cling to the Bible!<br/>
Cling to the Bible—<br/>
Our Lamp and our Guide!<br/>
<br/>
Cling to the Bible! This jewel and treasure<br/>
Brings life eternal, and saves fallen man;<br/>
Surely its value no mortal can measure:<br/>
Seek for its blessing, O soul, while you can!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lamp for the feet that in byways have wandered,<br/>
Guide for the youth that would otherwise fall;<br/>
Hope for the sinner whose life has been squandered,<br/>
Staff for the agèd, and best book of all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
