Christians, lo, the star appeareth;<br/>
Lo ’tis yet Messiah’s day;<br/>
Still with tribute treasure laden<br/>
Come the wise men on their way.<br/>
<br/>
Where a life is spent in service,<br/>
Walking where the Master trod,<br/>
There is scattered myrrh most fragrant<br/>
For the blessèd Christ of God.<br/>
<br/>
Whoso bears his brother’s burden,<br/>
Whoso shares another’s woe,<br/>
Brings his frankincense to Jesus<br/>
With the men of long ago.<br/>
<br/>
When we soothe earth’s weary children<br/>
Tending best the least of them,<br/>
’Tis the Lord himself we worship,<br/>
Bringing gold to Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
Christians, lo, the star appeareth<br/>
Leading still the ancient way;<br/>
Christians, onward with your treasure;<br/>
It is still Messiah’s day.
