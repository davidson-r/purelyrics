<center>
Now let me praise the keeper of Heaven's kingdom, <br/>
the might of the Creator, and his thought, <br/>
the work of the Father of glory, how each of wonders <br/>
the Eternal Lord established in the beginning. <br/>
He first created for the sons of men <br/>
Heaven as a roof, the holy Creator, <br/>
then Middle-earth the keeper of mankind, <br/>
the Eternal Lord, afterwards made, <br/>
the earth for men, the Almighty Lord.
