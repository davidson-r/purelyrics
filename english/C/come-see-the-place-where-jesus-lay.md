<br/>
Come, see the place where Jesus lay,<br/>
And hear angelic watchers say,<br/>
“He lives, Who once was slain:<br/>
Why seek the Living midst the dead?<br/>
Remember how the Savior said<br/>
That He would rise again.”<br/>
<br/>
O joyful sound! O glorious hour,<br/>
When by His own almighty power<br/>
He rose and left the grave!<br/>
Now let our songs His triumph tell,<br/>
Who burst the bands of death and hell,<br/>
And ever lives to save.<br/>
<br/>
The first begotten of the dead,<br/>
For us He rose, our glorious Head,<br/>
Immortal life to bring;<br/>
What though the saints like Him shall die,<br/>
They share their Leader’s victory,<br/>
And triumph with their King.<br/>
<br/>
No more they tremble at the grave,<br/>
For Jesus will their spirits save,<br/>
And raise their slumbering dust<br/>
O risen Lord, in Thee we live,<br/>
To Thee our ransomed souls we give,<br/>
To Thee our bodies trust.<br/>
