<br/>
Come to the Savior, make no delay;<br/>
Here in His Word He has shown us the way;<br/>
Here in our midst He’s standing today,<br/>
Tenderly saying, “Come!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Joyful, joyful will the meeting be,<br/>
When from sin our hearts are pure and free;<br/>
And we shall gather, Savior, with Thee,<br/>
In our eternal home.<br/>
<br/>
“Suffer the children!” oh, hear His voice!<br/>
Let ev’ry heart leap forth and rejoice;<br/>
And let us freely make Him our choice;<br/>
Do not delay, but come.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Think once again, He’s with us today;<br/>
Heed now His blest command, and obey;<br/>
Hear now His accents tenderly say,<br/>
“Will you, My children, come?”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
