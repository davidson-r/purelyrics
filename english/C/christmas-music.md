<br/>
Christmas music merrily wakes the echoes;<br/>
Hark! hark! how it freights the air;<br/>
While the storm-king holds his wildest revels,<br/>
Flings, flings snowdrifts everywhere;<br/>
From the belfry in the tower,<br/>
In the chapel on the hill,<br/>
Harmony descends like silver shower,<br/>
Or like sweetly flowing rill.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas music merrily wakes the echoes;<br/>
Hark! hark! over the city’s streets;<br/>
Pealing clearly while the snow is falling,<br/>
Pure, pure covering all it meets;<br/>
The cathedral’s deep-toned thunder<br/>
Joins a sweetly chiming bell,<br/>
And the passer, lost in joy and wonder,<br/>
Lists what metal tongues can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas music merrily wakes the echoes;<br/>
Hark! hark! sounding far and near;<br/>
Happy children lend their flute-like voices,<br/>
Praise, praise Christmas joy and cheer;<br/>
Sweetest music of the heart-strings,<br/>
Swept by fingers skilled by love,<br/>
Gives to life a charm so true, endearing,<br/>
Earth becomes like Heav’n above.<br/>
