<br/>
Christ Jesus lay in death’s strong bands, for our offenses given;<br/>
But now at God’s right hand He stands, and brings us life from heaven.<br/>
Wherefore let us joyful be, and sing to God right thankfully<br/>
Loud songs of Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
No son of man could conquer Death, such mischief sin had wrought us,<br/>
For innocence dwelt not on earth, and therefore Death had brought us<br/>
Into thralldom from of old and ever grew more strong and bold<br/>
And kept us in his bondage. Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
But Jesus Christ, God’s only Son, to our low state descended,<br/>
The cause of Death He has undone, his power forever ended,<br/>
Ruined all his right and claim and left him nothing but the name,<br/>
His sting is lost forever. Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
It was a strange and dreadful strife when life and death contended;<br/>
The victory remained with life; the reign of death was ended.<br/>
Stripped of power, no more it reigns, an empty form alone remains<br/>
Death’s sting is lost forever! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Here the true Paschal Lamb we see, Whom God so freely gave us;<br/>
He died on the accursed tree so strong His love to save us.<br/>
See, His blood doth mark our door; faith points to it, Death passes over,<br/>
And Satan cannot harm us. Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
So let us keep the festival where to the Lord invites us;<br/>
Christ is Himself the joy of all, the Sun that warms and lights us.<br/>
By His grace He doth impart eternal sunshine to the heart;<br/>
The night of sin is ended! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Then let us feast this Easter day on the true Bread of heaven;<br/>
The Word of grace hath purged away the old and wicked leaven.<br/>
Christ alone our souls will feed; He is our Meat and Drink indeed;<br/>
Faith lives upon no other! Alleluia!<br/>
