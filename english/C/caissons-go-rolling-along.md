<br/>
Over hill, over dale<br/>
As we hit the dusty trail,<br/>
And the Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
In and out, hear them shout,<br/>
Counter march and right about,<br/>
And the Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
<br/>
Then it's hi! hi! hee!<br/>
In the field artillery,<br/>
Shout out your numbers loud and strong,<br/>
For where e'er you go,<br/>
You will always know<br/>
That the Caissons go rolling along. <br/>
<br/>
In the storm, in the night,<br/>
Action left or action right<br/>
See those Caissons go rolling along<br/>
Limber front, limber rear,<br/>
Prepare to mount your cannoneer<br/>
And those Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
<br/>
Then it's hi! hi! hee!<br/>
In the field artillery,<br/>
Shout out your numbers loud and strong,<br/>
For where e'er you go,<br/>
You will always know<br/>
That the Caissons go rolling along. <br/>
<br/>
Was it high, was it low,<br/>
Where the hell did that one go?<br/>
As those Caissons go rolling along<br/>
Was it left, was it right,<br/>
Now we won't get home tonight<br/>
And those Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then it's hi! hi! hee!<br/>
In the field artillery,<br/>
Shout out your numbers loud and strong,<br/>
For where e'er you go,<br/>
You will always know<br/>
That the Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
That the Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
That the Caissons go rolling along.<br/>
