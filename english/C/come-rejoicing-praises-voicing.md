Come rejoicing, praises voicing,<br/>
Christmas Day is breaking;<br/>
Now th’Eternal, Lord supernal,<br/>
Human form is taking.<br/>
On the hay - lo, behold<br/>
Virgin’s Son, as foretold,<br/>
Lies the precious Infant in the wintry cold,<br/>
Lies the precious Infant in the wintry cold.<br/>
<br/>
Unabated for Him waited<br/>
Many generations;<br/>
Him now proudly angels loudly<br/>
Praise the Hope of nations.<br/>
Let us, then, gladly sing,<br/>
Let our songs gaily ring,<br/>
As we to this holy Child our praises bring,<br/>
As we to this holy Child our praises bring.<br/>
<br/>
Tender Flower, Mighty Tower,<br/>
Jesus Christ, our Savior;<br/>
Heav’nly Treasure, without measure,<br/>
Thee we love forever.<br/>
Lord and King without end,<br/>
Our poor hearts now befriend,<br/>
All Thy gifts of grace and goodness to us send,<br/>
All Thy gifts of grace and goodness to us send.
