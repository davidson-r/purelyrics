<center>
Come, Thou long expected Jesus<br/>
Born to set Thy people free;<br/>
From our fears and sins release us,<br/>
Let us find our rest in Thee.<br/>
Israelâ€™s Strength and Consolation,<br/>
Hope of all the earth Thou art;<br/>
Dear Desire of every nation,<br/>
Joy of every longing heart.<br/>
<br/>
Born Thy people to deliver,<br/>
Born a child and yet a King,<br/>
Born to reign in us forever,<br/>
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.<br/>
By Thine own eternal Spirit<br/>
Rule in all our hearts alone;<br/>
By Thine all sufficient merit,<br/>
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
