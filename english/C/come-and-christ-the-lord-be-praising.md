<br/>
Come, and Christ the Lord be praising,<br/>
Heart and mind to Him be raising,<br/>
Celebrate His love amazing,<br/>
Worthy folk of Christendom.<br/>
<br/>
Sin, death, hell, may all be grieving,<br/>
Satan shame feel to him cleaving;<br/>
We salvation free receiving,<br/>
Cast our every care away.<br/>
<br/>
See what God for us provideth,<br/>
Life that in His Son abideth,<br/>
And our weary steps He guideth<br/>
From earth’s woe to heav’nly joy.<br/>
<br/>
His soul deeply for us feeleth,<br/>
He His love to us revealeth,<br/>
He Who is in the heavens dwelleth<br/>
Came to save us from our foe.<br/>
<br/>
Jacob’s star His advent maketh,<br/>
Soothes the longing heart that acheth,<br/>
And the serpent’s head He breaketh,<br/>
Scattering the powers of hell.<br/>
<br/>
Op’d hath He and freedom gained us<br/>
From the prison that contained us,<br/>
Where much grief and sorrow pained us,<br/>
And our hearts were bowed with woe.<br/>
<br/>
O blest hour when we receivèd<br/>
From the foe who us deceivèd<br/>
Liberty, when we believèd,<br/>
And Thee, gracious Spirit, praised.<br/>
<br/>
Beauteous Infant in the manger,<br/>
O befriend us! beyond danger<br/>
Bring us where is turned God’s anger<br/>
Where with angel hosts we’ll praise.<br/>
