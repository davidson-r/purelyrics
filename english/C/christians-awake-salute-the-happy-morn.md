<br/>
Christians, awake, salute the happy morn<br/>
Whereon the Saviour of the world was born<br/>
Rise to adore the mystery of love<br/>
Which hosts of angels chanted from above<br/>
With them the joyful tidings first begun<br/>
Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son<br/>
<br/>
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told<br/>
Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,<br/>
I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth<br/>
To you and all the nations upon earth<br/>
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word;<br/>
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord."<br/>
<br/>
He spake, and straightaway the celestial choir<br/>
In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire<br/>
The praises of redeeming love they sang<br/>
And heaven's whole orb with alleluias rang<br/>
God's highest glory was their anthem still<br/>
Peace upon earth and unto men goodwill<br/>
<br/>
To Bethlehem straight the shepherds ran<br/>
To see the wonder God had wrought for man<br/>
And found, with Joseph and the blessed Maid<br/>
Her Son, the Saviour, in a manger laid<br/>
Amazed, the wondrous story they proclaim<br/>
The earliest heralds of the Saviour's name<br/>
<br/>
Let us, like these good shepherds, them employ<br/>
Our grateful voices to proclaim the joy<br/>
Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss<br/>
From His poor manger to His bitter cross<br/>
Treading His steps, assisted by His grace<br/>
Till man's first heavenly state again takes place<br/>
<br/>
Then may we hope, the angelic thrones among<br/>
To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song<br/>
He that was born upon this joyful day<br/>
Around us all His glory shall display<br/>
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing<br/>
Of angels and of angel-men the King.<br/>
