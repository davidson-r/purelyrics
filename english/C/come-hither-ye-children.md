title: Come Hither Ye Children

Come hither, ye children, O come one and all,<br/>
To Bethlehem haste, to the manger so small;<br/>
God’s Son for a gift has been sent you this night<br/>
To be your Redeemer, your joy and delight.<br/>
<br/>
He’s born in a stable for you and for me,<br/>
Draw near by the bright gleaming starlight to see,<br/>
In swaddling clothes lying, so meek and so mild,<br/>
And purer than angels—the heavenly Child.<br/>
<br/>
See Mary and Joseph with love-beaming eyes<br/>
Are gazing upon the rude bed where He lies;<br/>
The shepherds are kneeling, with hearts full of love,<br/>
While angels sing loud hallelujahs above.<br/>
<br/>
Kneel down and adore Him with shepherds today,<br/>
Lift up little hands now and praise Him as they;<br/>
Rejoice that a Savior from sin you can boast,<br/>
And join in the song of the heavenly host.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, my Savior, what must not be done,<br/>
What must not be suffered for sin to atone!<br/>
From infancy sorrow and pain Thou must know<br/>
Till Thou on the cross tasteth death’s bitter woe.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Christ Child, what gifts can we children bestow,<br/>
By which our affection and gladness to show?<br/>
No riches and treasures of value can be,<br/>
But hearts that believe are accepted with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Our hearts, then, to Thee we will offer today,<br/>
We offer them gladly; accept them we pray,<br/>
And make them so spotless and pure that we may<br/>
Abide in Thy presence in Heaven for aye.
