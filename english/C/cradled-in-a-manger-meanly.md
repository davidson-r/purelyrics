<br/>
Cradled in a manger, meanly,<br/>
Laid the Son of Man His head;<br/>
Sleeping His first earthly slumber<br/>
Where the oxen had been fed.<br/>
Happy were those shepherds listening<br/>
To the holy angel’s word;<br/>
Happy they within that stable<br/>
Worshipping their infant Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Happy all who hear the message<br/>
Of His coming from above;<br/>
Happier still who hail His coming,<br/>
And with praises greet His love.<br/>
Blessèd Savior, Christ most holy,<br/>
In a manger Thou didst rest;<br/>
Canst Thou stoop again, yet lower,<br/>
And abide within my breast?<br/>
<br/>
Evil things are there before Thee;<br/>
In the heart, where they have fed,<br/>
Wilt Thou pitifully enter,<br/>
Son of Man, and lay Thy head?<br/>
Enter, then, O Christ most holy;<br/>
Make a Christmas in my heart;<br/>
Make a heaven of my manger:<br/>
It is heaven where Thou art.<br/>
<br/>
And to those who never listened<br/>
To the message of Thy birth,<br/>
Who have winter, but no Christmas<br/>
Bringing them Thy peace on earth,<br/>
Send to these the joyful tidings;<br/>
By all people, in each home,<br/>
Be there heard the Christmas anthem;<br/>
Praise to God, the Christ has come!<br/>
