<br/>
Christian, dost thou see them on the holy ground,<br/>
How the powers of darkness rage thy steps around?<br/>
Christian, up and smite them, counting gain but loss,<br/>
In the strength that cometh by the holy cross.<br/>
<br/>
Christian, dost thou feel them, how they work within,<br/>
Striving, tempting, luring, goading into sin?<br/>
Christian, never tremble; never be downcast;<br/>
Gird thee for the battle, watch and pray and fast.<br/>
<br/>
Christian, dost thou hear them, how they speak thee fair?<br/>
“Always fast and vigil? Always watch and prayer?”<br/>
Christian, answer boldly: “While I breathe I pray!”<br/>
Peace shall follow battle, night shall end in day.<br/>
<br/>
“Well I know thy trouble, O my servant true;<br/>
Thou art very weary, I was weary, too;<br/>
But that toil shall make thee some day all Mine own,<br/>
At the end of sorrow shall be near my throne.”<br/>
