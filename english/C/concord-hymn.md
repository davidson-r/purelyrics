<center>
<br/>
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br/>
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled;<br/>
Here once the embattled farmers stood;<br/>
And fired the shot heard round the world.<br/>
<br/>
The foe long since in silence slept;<br/>
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps,<br/>
And Time the ruined bridge has swept<br/>
Down the dark stream that seaward creeps.<br/>
<br/>
On this green bank, by this soft stream,<br/>
We place with joy a votive stone,<br/>
That memory may their deeds redeem,<br/>
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou who made those heroes dare<br/>
To die, and leave their children free, <br/>
Bid Time and Nature gently spare<br/>
The shaft we raised to them and Thee.<br/>
