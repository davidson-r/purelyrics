title: Christ Whose Glory Fills The Skies

<center>
Christ, Whose glory fills the skies,<br/>
Christ, the true, the only Light,<br/>
Sun of Righteousness, arise,<br/>
Triumph o’er the shades of night;<br/>
Dayspring from on high be near;<br/>
Day-star, in my heart appear.<br/>
<br/>
Dark and cheerless is the morn<br/>
Unaccompanied by Thee;<br/>
Joyless is the day’s return<br/>
Till Thy mercy’s beams I see;<br/>
Till they inward light impart,<br/>
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Visit then this soul of mine,<br/>
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;<br/>
Fill me, Radiancy divine,<br/>
Scatter all my unbelief;<br/>
More and more Thyself display,<br/>
Shining to the perfect day.
