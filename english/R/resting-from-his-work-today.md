title: Resting From His Work Today

Resting from His work today<br/>
In the tomb the Savior lay;<br/>
Still He slept, from head to feet<br/>
Shrouded in the winding sheet,<br/>
Lying in the rock alone,<br/>
Hidden by the sealèd stone.<br/>
<br/>
Late at even there was seen<br/>
Watching long the Magdalene;<br/>
Early, ere the break of day,<br/>
Sorrowful she took her way<br/>
To the holy garden glade,<br/>
Where her buried Lord was laid.<br/>
<br/>
So with Thee, till life shall end,<br/>
I would solemn vigil spend:<br/>
Let me hew Thee, Lord, a shrine<br/>
In this rocky heart of mine,<br/>
Where in pure embalmèd cell,<br/>
None but Thou may ever dwell.<br/>
<br/>
Myrrh and spices will I bring,<br/>
True affection’s offering;<br/>
Close the doors from sight and sound<br/>
Of the busy world around;<br/>
And in patient watch remain<br/>
Till my Lord appear again.
