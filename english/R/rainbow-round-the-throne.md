title: Rainbow round the throne

<br/>
When the clouds hang dark and heavy,<br/>
And the rolling surge we hear,<br/>
When no earthly pow’r can shield us<br/>
From the storm that most we fear,<br/>
O ’tis then our Father’s presence<br/>
To the trusting heart is shown,<br/>
In a bright and glorious vision<br/>
Of the rainbow round the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O the rainbow round the throne!<br/>
Lovely rainbow round the throne!<br/>
Ever brilliant, ever sparkling<br/>
Shines the rainbow round the throne.<br/>
<br/>
When we stand amid the conflict<br/>
Of the battle raging high,<br/>
When the tempter seems to triumph,<br/>
And our ranks desponding fly,<br/>
With the fleetness of an arrow<br/>
God’s protecting care is shown,<br/>
In the brightness that descendeth<br/>
From the rainbow round the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When the veil of time is lifted,<br/>
And the shadows melt away,<br/>
When we fall asleep in Jesus,<br/>
And awake in endless day,<br/>
When the battle march is ended,<br/>
And our cares and tears have flown,<br/>
We shall gaze, and gaze forever,<br/>
On the rainbow round the throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
