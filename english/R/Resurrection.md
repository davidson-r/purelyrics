<br/>
In the resurrection morning<br/>
We will see the Savior coming,<br/>
And the sons of God a-shouting in the kingdom of the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When the trump of God shall sound,<br/>
When the trump of God shall sound,<br/>
It shall wake the sleeping nations,<br/>
When the trump of God shall sound!<br/>
The dead in Christ shall rise,<br/>
The dead in Christ shall rise.<br/>
<br/>
We feel the advent glory<br/>
While the vision seems to tarry,<br/>
We will comfort one another with the words of Holy Writ.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
By faith we can discover<br/>
That our warfare’ll soon be over,<br/>
And we’ll shortly hail each other on fair Heaven’s happy shore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We will tell the pleasing story<br/>
When we meet our friends in glory,<br/>
And we’ll keep ourselves all ready for to hail the heav’nly King.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
