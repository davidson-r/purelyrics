<br/>
Is there any room for Jesus?<br/>
He Who died on Calvary,<br/>
He Who standeth, knocking, waiting,<br/>
Pleading with you tenderly.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Room for Jesus, room for Jesus,<br/>
Let Him in your heart today,<br/>
Throwing every window open,<br/>
O receive Him while you may.<br/>
<br/>
We have room for worldly pleasures,<br/>
Cares of life crowd every day,<br/>
And our hearts and minds are burdened<br/>
While the Lord is turned away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Will you not make room for Jesus,<br/>
For the Christ, the Crucified?<br/>
Is there not some place to enter<br/>
In the soul for which He died?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Room and time and thought for Jesus,<br/>
Hasten to accept His grace<br/>
Ere the heart grows cold and careless,<br/>
And His pleading voice shall cease.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
