title: Rise From Your Graves Ye Dead

<center>
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!” Thus shall the call be sounded,<br/>
Which on the latter day shall find us all astounded;<br/>
Which to the faithful flock shall promise rare delight,<br/>
And fill the trembling hearts of sinners with affright.<br/>
<br/>
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!” Your sleep at last is over,<br/>
Ye blessèd of the Lord, no more without shall hover.<br/>
The garments are prepared, the crowns for you are stored,<br/>
Enter into the joy and comfort of your Lord!<br/>
<br/>
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!” Come from your earthly cover;<br/>
Ye wicked all the pangs of hell shall now discover.<br/>
Ye once rejected Me, I hold you nothing worth;<br/>
Wailing and gnashing teeth shall be your lot henceforth.<br/>
<br/>
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!” Lo, here are bone and tissue<br/>
Flesh, sinew, hands, eye, foot! from earth and air they issue.<br/>
That wherewith you have served the Lord is glorified,<br/>
That wherewith you have sinned, consumed and cast aside.<br/>
<br/>
“Rise from your graves, ye dead!” Ye faithful now shall glory<br/>
In halos like the sun, undimmed, untransitory.<br/>
Immortal bodies with immortal souls shall blend,<br/>
Ye shall enjoy the rest of saints that hath no end.
