title: Rest at Home

<center>
<br/>
Whate’er my afflictions or trials may be,<br/>
I want to live faithful, my Savior, to Thee,<br/>
To walk as a Christian, my temper subdued,<br/>
And feel, through Thy mercy, in spirit renewed.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Home, home, home, sweet, sweet home,<br/>
I know there is rest with Thy people at home,<br/>
I know there is rest with Thy people at home.<br/>
<br/>
Though dark is my path in this valley of sin,<br/>
O give me the light of Thy comfort within,<br/>
To shield me from danger wherever I roam,<br/>
And guide me at last to Thy people at home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I want to be humble, resigned to Thy will,<br/>
In sunshine or tempest to follow Thee still,<br/>
Yet, lured by the tempter, how often I roam,<br/>
Forgetful, alas! of my God and my home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No parent so tender, so friend is so dear,<br/>
No voice like my Savior’s can banish my fear;<br/>
By faith in Thy promise to Thee I will come,<br/>
O, give me a place with Thy people at home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When shall I rise from this desert of gloom,<br/>
Beyond the deep shadows that darken the tomb,<br/>
In Eden, dear Eden, transported to roam,<br/>
And sing hallelujahs with angels at home?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
