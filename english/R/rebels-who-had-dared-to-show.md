Rebels, who had dared to show<br/>
Proud contempt of God Most High<br/>
Bound in iron and in woe,<br/>
Shades of death and darkness nigh,<br/>
Humbled low with toil and pain,<br/>
Fell, and looked for help in vain.<br/>
<br/>
To Jehovah when they cried<br/>
In their trouble, and He saved,<br/>
Threw the prison open wide<br/>
Where they lay to death enslaved,<br/>
Bade the gloomy shadows flee,<br/>
Broke their bonds and set them free.<br/>
<br/>
Sons of men, awake to praise<br/>
God the Lord Who reigns above,<br/>
Gracious in His works and ways,<br/>
Wondrous in redeeming love;<br/>
Longing souls He satisfies,<br/>
Hungry hearts with good supplies.<br/>
<br/>
When His righteous judgments come,<br/>
Strong to bless and to destroy,<br/>
All iniquity is dumb,<br/>
All the righteous sing for joy;<br/>
Who Godâ€™s dealings wisely heed,<br/>
In His works His mercy read.<br/>
