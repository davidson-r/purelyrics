<br/>
Rejoice today with one accord,<br/>
Sing out with exultation;<br/>
Rejoice and praise our mighty Lord,<br/>
Whose arm hath brought salvation;<br/>
His works of love proclaim<br/>
The greatness of His Name;<br/>
For He is God alone<br/>
Who hath His mercy shown;<br/>
Let all His saints adore Him!<br/>
<br/>
When in distress to Him we cried,<br/>
He heard our sad complaining;<br/>
O trust in Him, whate’er betide,<br/>
His love is all sustaining;<br/>
Triumphant songs of praise<br/>
To Him our hearts shall raise;<br/>
Now every voice shall say,<br/>
“O praise our God alway”;<br/>
Let all His saints adore Him!<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice today with one accord,<br/>

Rejoice and praise our mighty Lord,<br/>
Whose arm hath brought salvation;<br/>
His works of love proclaim<br/>
The greatness of His Name;<br/>
For He is God alone<br/>
Who hath His mercy shown;<br/>
Let all His saints adore Him!<br/>
