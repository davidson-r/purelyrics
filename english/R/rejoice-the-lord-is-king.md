<br/>
Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore;<br/>
Mortals give thanks and sing, and triumph evermore;<br/>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;<br/>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, the Savior, reigns, the God of truth and love;<br/>
When He had purged our stains He took His seat above;<br/>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;<br/>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br/>
<br/>
His kingdom cannot fail, He rules o’er earth and Heav’n,<br/>
The keys of death and hell are to our Jesus giv’n;<br/>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;<br/>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br/>
<br/>
He sits at God’s right hand till all His foes submit,<br/>
And bow to His command, and fall beneath His feet:<br/>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;<br/>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br/>
<br/>
He all His foes shall quell, shall all our sins destroy,<br/>
And every bosom swell with pure seraphic joy;<br/>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,<br/>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice in glorious hope! Jesus the Judge shall come,<br/>
And take His servants up to their eternal home.<br/>
We soon shall hear th’archangel’s voice;<br/>
The trump of God shall sound, rejoice!<br/>
