<br/>
Ring out the bells for Christmas,<br/>
The happy, happy day;<br/>
In winter wild, the holy Child<br/>
Within the cradle lay.<br/>
O wonderful! the Savior<br/>
Is in the manger lone;<br/>
His palace is a stable,<br/>
And Mary’s arms His throne.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Ring out the bells for Christmas,<br/>
The merry, merry Christmas,<br/>
Ring out the bells for Christmas,<br/>
The happy, happy day.<br/>
<br/>
On Beth’lem’s quiet hillside,<br/>
In ages long gone by,<br/>
In angel notes the glory floats,<br/>
“Glory to God on high.”<br/>
Yet wakes the sun as joyous<br/>
As when the Lord was born,<br/>
And still He comes to greet you<br/>
On ev’ry Christmas morn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Where’er His sweet lambs gather,<br/>
Within this gentle fold<br/>
The Savior dear is waiting near,<br/>
As in the days of old.<br/>
In each young heart you see Him,<br/>
In ev’ry guileless face,<br/>
You see the holy Jesus,<br/>
Who grew in truth and grace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In many a darksome cottage,<br/>
In many a crowded street,<br/>
In winter bleak, with shiv’ring cheek,<br/>
The homeless child you meet.<br/>
Gaze upon the pale, wan features,<br/>
The feet with wand’ring sore.<br/>
You see the souls He loveth,<br/>
The Christ Child at the door.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then sing your gladsome carols,<br/>
And hail the newborn Sun;<br/>
For Christmas light is passing bright,<br/>
It smiles on everyone;<br/>
And feast Christ’s little children,<br/>
His poor, his orphans call,<br/>
For He Who chose the manger,<br/>
He loveth one and all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
