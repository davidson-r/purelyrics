title: Rites Cannot Change The Heart

<center>
<br/>
Rites cannot change the heart,<br/>
Undo the evil done,<br/>
Or with the uttered name impart<br/>
The nature of Thy Son.<br/>
<br/>
To meet our desperate want,<br/>
There gushed a crimson flood;<br/>
O from His heart’s o’erflowing font<br/>
Baptize this soul with blood!<br/>
<br/>
Be grace from Christ our Lord,<br/>
And love from God supreme,<br/>
By the communing Spirit poured<br/>
In a perpetual stream!<br/>
