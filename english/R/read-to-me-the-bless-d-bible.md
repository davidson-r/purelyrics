<br/>
Read to me the blessèd Bible,<br/>
On its sacred pages shine<br/>
Grace and truth and tender mercy,<br/>
And a Savior’s love divine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Read the Bible,<br/>
Now the lamp of life burns low,<br/>
These will cheer me,<br/>
When the agèd feet move slow.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis a fount of living water,<br/>
Where the soul its thirst may slake,<br/>
Bread of life it freely offers,<br/>
Unto all who will partake.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Read to me the blessèd Bible,<br/>
Read it carefully and slow,<br/>
’Tis a refuge and a shelter,<br/>
From the stormy winds that blow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
It is comfort for the troubled,<br/>
To the lonely ’tis a guest,<br/>
For the penitent, ’tis pardon,<br/>
To the weary it is rest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When you read about the City,<br/>
Whose fair day ne’er ends with night,<br/>
Death is not the king of terrors,<br/>
But a messenger of light.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
