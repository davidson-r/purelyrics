<br/>
There’s a star in the East on Christmas morn,<br/>
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
It will lead to the place where the Christ was born,<br/>
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Follow, follow, rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
Follow the Star of Bethlehem,<br/>
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
<br/>
If you take good heed to the angel’s words,<br/>
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
You’ll forget your flocks, you’ll forget your herds,<br/>
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
