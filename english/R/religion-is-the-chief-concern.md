Religion is the chief concern<br/>
Of mortals here below:<br/>
May I its great importance learn<br/>
Its sovereign virtue know!<br/>
<br/>
More needful this than glittering wealth<br/>
Or aught the world bestows;<br/>
Nor reputation, food nor health,<br/>
Can give us such repose.<br/>
<br/>
Religion should our thoughts engage,<br/>
Amidst our youthful bloom;<br/>
’Twill fit us for declining age,<br/>
And for the awful tomb.<br/>
<br/>
O may my heart, by grace renewed,<br/>
Be my Redeemer’s throne;<br/>
And be my stubborn will subdued,<br/>
His government to own!<br/>
<br/>
Let deep repentance, faith, and love<br/>
Be joined with godly fear;<br/>
And all my conversation prove<br/>
My heart to be sincere.<br/>
<br/>
Let lively hope my soul inspire;<br/>
Let warm affections rise;<br/>
And may I wait with strong desire<br/>
To mount above the skies!<br/>
