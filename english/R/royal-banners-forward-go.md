<br/>
The royal banners forward go,<br/>
The cross shines forth in mystic glow;<br/>
Where He in flesh, our flesh Who made,<br/>
Our sentence bore, our ransom paid.<br/>
<br/>
Where deep for us the spear was dyed,<br/>
Lifeâ€™s torrent rushing from His side,<br/>
To wash us in that precious flood,<br/>
Where mingled water flowed, and blood.<br/>
<br/>
Fulfilled is all that David told<br/>
In true prophetic song of old,<br/>
Amidst the nations, God, saith he,<br/>
Hath reigned and triumphed from the tree.<br/>
<br/>
O tree of beauty, tree of light!<br/>
O tree with royal purple dight!<br/>
Elect on whose triumphal breast<br/>
Those holy limbs should find their rest.<br/>
<br/>
Blest tree, whose chosen branches bore<br/>
The wealth that did the world restore,<br/>
The price of humankind to pay,<br/>
And spoil the spoiler of his prey.<br/>
<br/>
Upon its arms, like balance true,<br/>
He weighed the price for sinners due,<br/>
The price which none but He could pay,<br/>
And spoiled the spoiler of his prey.<br/>
<br/>
O cross, our one reliance, hail!<br/>
Still may thy power with us avail<br/>
To give new virtue to the saint,<br/>
And pardon to the penitent.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee, eternal Three in One,<br/>
Let homage meet by all be done:<br/>
As by the cross Thou dost restore,<br/>
So rule and guide us evermore.<br/>
