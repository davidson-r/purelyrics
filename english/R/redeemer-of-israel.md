<br/>
Redeemer of Israel, our only Delight,<br/>
On Whom for a blessing we call,<br/>
Our Shadow by day, and our Pillar by night,<br/>
Our King, our Deliverer, our All!<br/>
<br/>
We know He is coming, to gather His sheep<br/>
And lead them to Zion in love;<br/>
For why in the valley of death should they weep<br/>
Or in the lone wilderness rove?<br/>
<br/>
How long we have wandered as strangers in sin,<br/>
And cried in the desert for Thee!<br/>
Our foes have rejoiced when our sorrows theyâ€™ve seen,<br/>
But Israel will shortly be free.<br/>
<br/>
As children of Zion, good tidings for us.<br/>
The tokens already appear.<br/>
Fear not, and be just, for the kingdom is ours.<br/>
The hour of redemption is near.<br/>
