<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice this happy morn,<br/>
A Savior unto us is born,<br/>
The Christ the Lord of Glory.<br/>
His lowly birth in Bethlehem<br/>
The angels from on high proclaim<br/>
And sing redemption’s story.<br/>
My soul, extol God’s great favor,<br/>
Bless Him ever for salvation.<br/>
Give Him praise and adoration.<br/>
