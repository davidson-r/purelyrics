<br/>
’Tis a blessèd hope, and it cheers my soul,<br/>
I shall rest by and by over Jordan;<br/>
When my work is done and my crown is won,<br/>
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Over Jordan, over Jordan, I shall rest<br/>
Sweetly rest by and by;<br/>
’Tis a precious hope, ’tis a blessèd hope,<br/>
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis a blessèd hope which my Savior gives,<br/>
I shall rest by and by over Jordan;<br/>
I shall see Him there in His mansion fair,<br/>
When I rest, sweetly rest over Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
With a steadfast faith I will labor on,<br/>
I shall rest, sweetly rest over Jordan;<br/>
O what joy ’twill be the redeemed to see,<br/>
When I rest, sweetly rest, over Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
