title: Roseate Hues Of Early Dawn

The roseate hues of early dawn, the brightness of the day,<br/>
The crimson of the sunset sky, how fast they fade away!<br/>
O for the pearly gates of Heavâ€™n! O for the golden floor!<br/>
O for the Sun of Righteousness that setteth nevermore!<br/>
<br/>
The highest hopes we cherish here, how fast they tire and faint!<br/>
How many a spot defiles the robe that wraps an earthly saint!<br/>
O for a heart that never sins! O for a soul washed white!<br/>
O for a voice to praise our King, nor weary day or night!<br/>
<br/>
Here faith is ours, and heavenly hopes, and grace to lead us higher;<br/>
But there are perfectness and peace beyond our best desire.<br/>
O by Thy love and anguish, Lord, O by Thy life laid down,<br/>
Grant that we fall not from Thy grace, nor cast away our crown!
