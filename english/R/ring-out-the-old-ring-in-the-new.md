<br/>
Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br/>
Ring, happy bells, across the snow;<br/>
The year is going, let him go;<br/>
Ring out the false, ring in the true.<br/>
<br/>
Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br/>
The flying cloud, the frosty light:<br/>
The year is dying in the night;<br/>
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.<br/>
<br/>
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br/>
For those that here we see no more;<br/>
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br/>
Ring in redress to all mankind.<br/>
<br/>
Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br/>
The civic slander and the spite;<br/>
Ring in the love of truth and right,<br/>
Ring in the common love of good.<br/>
<br/>
Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br/>
And ancient forms of party strife,<br/>
Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br/>
With sweet manners, purer laws.<br/>
<br/>
Ring out old shapes of foul disease;<br/>
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br/>
Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br/>
Ring in the thousand years of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Ring in the valiant man and free,<br/>
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;<br/>
Ring out the darkness of the land,<br/>
Ring in the Christ that is to be.<br/>
