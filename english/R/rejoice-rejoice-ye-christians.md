<br/>
Rejoice, rejoice, ye Christians, with all your heart this morn!<br/>
O hear the blessèd tidings, the Lord, the Christ is born,<br/>
Now brought us by the angels that stand about God’s throne;<br/>
O lovely are the voices that make such tidings known!<br/>
<br/>
O hearken to their singing! This Child shall be your Friend;<br/>
The Father so hath willed it, that thus your woes should end.<br/>
The Son is freely given, that in Him ye may have<br/>
The Father’s grace and blessing, and know He loves to save.<br/>
<br/>
Nor deem the form too lowly that clothes Him at this hour;<br/>
For know ye what it hideth? ’Tis God’s almighty power.<br/>
Though now within the manger so poor and weak He lies,<br/>
He is the Lord of all things, He reigns above the skies.<br/>
