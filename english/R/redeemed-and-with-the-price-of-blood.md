<br/>
Redeemed, and with the price of blood,<br/>
Which Thou hast shed for me,<br/>
I stand, a monument of grace,<br/>
A witness, Lord, for Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Redeemed, and made by simple faith<br/>
An heir of heaven above!<br/>
Oh, love surpassing human thought!<br/>
Oh, vast, unmeasured love!<br/>
<br/>
Redeemed, no longer dead in sin,<br/>
But raised by pow’r divine,<br/>
My tongue, rejoicing, cries aloud,<br/>
All glory, Lord, be Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Redeemed, my heart is filled with praise,<br/>
My soul true comfort knows,<br/>
And daily feels the calm of peace<br/>
That like a river flows.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Redeemed, I’ll tell it o’er and o’er;<br/>
Redeemed my song shall be,<br/>
My watchword through the vale of death,<br/>
My passport home to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
