<br/>
Royal songs, for the young and old,<br/>
Of the King of Grace and His precious fold,<br/>
Where the soul may turn and with joy come in,<br/>
At the door of grace, from the paths of sin.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Royal songs, royal songs,<br/>
Royal songs when the ransomed<br/>
Shall lay their trophies down.<br/>
<br/>
Royal songs, for the weary one,<br/>
Of a peaceful rest when the work is done,<br/>
Songs of love and praise to our mighty King,<br/>
From the hearts of all may they sweetly ring.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Royal songs, of a glorious land,<br/>
Where the pure in heart with the angels stand,<br/>
And the Saviorâ€™s voice of eternal love<br/>
Shall the welcome be to that home above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
