<br/>
Ring, happy bells of Easter time,<br/>
The world is glad to hear your chime;<br/>
Across wide fields of melting snow<br/>
The winds of summer softly blow,<br/>
And birds and streams repeat the chime<br/>
Of Easter time, of Easter time:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The world is glad to hear your chime;<br/>
Ring, happy bells of Easter time!<br/>
<br/>
Ring, happy bells of Easter time,<br/>
The world takes up your chant sublime;<br/>
The Lord is risen, the night of fear<br/>
Has passed away and heaven draws near:<br/>
We breaThe air of that blest clime,<br/>
At Easter time, at Easter time:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Ring, happy bells of Easter time,<br/>
Our happy hearts give back your chime;<br/>
The Lord is risen, we die no more:<br/>
He opens wide the heavenly door;<br/>
He meets us, while to Him we climb,<br/>
At Easter time, at Easter time:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
