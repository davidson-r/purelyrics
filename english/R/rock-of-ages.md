<center>
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br/>
Let me hide myself in Thee;<br/>
Let the water and the blood,<br/>
From Thy wounded side which flowed,<br/>
Be of sin the double cure;<br/>
Save from wrath and make me pure.<br/>
<br/>
Not the labor of my hands<br/>
Can fulfill Thy lawâ€™s demands;<br/>
Could my zeal no respite know,<br/>
Could my tears forever flow,<br/>
All for sin could not atone;<br/>
Thou must save, and Thou alone.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in my hand I bring,<br/>
Simply to the cross I cling;<br/>
Naked, come to Thee for dress;<br/>
Helpless look to Thee for grace;<br/>
Foul, I to the fountain fly;<br/>
Wash me, Savior, or I die.<br/>
<br/>
While I draw this fleeting breath,<br/>
When mine eyes shall close in death,<br/>
When I soar to worlds unknown,<br/>
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,<br/>
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br/>
Let me hide myself in Thee
