<br/>
Righteous Father, we have wronged Thee,<br/>
Underfoot Thy laws have cast:<br/>
Now we fain would serve Thee better,<br/>
O forgive us what is past.<br/>
<br/>
Loving Jesus, we have hurt Thee,<br/>
Yielded to temptationâ€™s blast:<br/>
Now we long to stand more firmly,<br/>
O forgive us what is past.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Spirit, we have grieved Thee,<br/>
Sin and death have held us fast:<br/>
Now we yearn for life and freedom,<br/>
O forgive us what is past.<br/>
<br/>
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br/>
God eternal, first and last,<br/>
Penitent we kneel before Thee,<br/>
O forgive us all the past.<br/>
