<br/>
The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want;<br/>
He makes me down to lie<br/>
In pastures green; he leadeth me<br/>
The quiet waters by.<br/>
<br/>
My soul he doth restore again,<br/>
And me to walk doth make<br/>
Within the paths of righteousness,<br/>
E'en for his own name's sake.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,<br/>
Yet will I fear no ill:<br/>
For thou art with me, and thy rod<br/>
And staff me comfort still.<br/>
<br/>
My table thou hast furnished<br/>
In prsence of my foes;<br/>
My head thou dost with oil anoint<br/>
And my cup overflows.<br/>
<br/>
Goodness and mercy all my life<br/>
Shall surely follow me;<br/>
And in God's house for evermore<br/>
My dwelling-place shall be.<br/>
Â <br/>
