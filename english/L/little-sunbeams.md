<br/>
I think God gives the children, as through the land they go,<br/>
The most delightful mission that anyone can know.<br/>
He wants us to be sunbeams of love and hope and cheer,<br/>
To brighten up the shadows that often gather here.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O we are little sunbeams, sent down from God to man;<br/>
In all life’s shady places, we shine as best we can.<br/>
<br/>
The clouds may hide the sunshine of Heaven from our sight,<br/>
And life have much of sorrow to mar the heart’s delight;<br/>
But if like faithful sunbeams, we children do our part,<br/>
We’ll bring a ray of brightness to every shadowed heart.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then let us live our mission of sunbeams day by day,<br/>
And scatter joy and brightness about us all the way;<br/>
Let’s chase away life’s shadows with loving thought and deed<br/>
And be the sunshine makers, of which the world has need.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
