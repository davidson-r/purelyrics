Lord and Savior, true and kind,<br/>
Be the Master of my mind;<br/>
Bless, and guide, and strengthen still<br/>
All my powers of thought and will.<br/>
<br/>
While I ply the scholar’s task,<br/>
Jesus Christ, be near, I ask;<br/>
Help the memory, clear the brain,<br/>
Knowledge still to seek and gain.<br/>
<br/>
Here I train for life’s swift race;<br/>
Let me do it in Thy grace;<br/>
Here I arm me for life’s fight;<br/>
Let me do it in Thy might.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast made me mind and soul;<br/>
I for Thee would use the whole;<br/>
Thou hast died that I might live;<br/>
All my powers to Thee I give.<br/>
<br/>
Striving, thinking, learning, still,<br/>
Let me follow thus Thy will,<br/>
Till my whole glad nature be<br/>
Trained for duty and for Thee.
