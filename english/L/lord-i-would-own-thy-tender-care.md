title: Lord I Would Own Thy Tender Care

<br/>
Lord, I would own Thy tender care,<br/>
And all Thy love to me;<br/>
The food I eat, the clothes I wear,<br/>
Are all bestowed by Thee.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis Thou preservest me from death<br/>
And dangers every hour;<br/>
I cannot draw another breath<br/>
Unless Thou give me power.<br/>
<br/>
Kind angels guard me every night,<br/>
As round my bed they stay:<br/>
Nor am I absent from Thy sight<br/>
In darkness or by day.<br/>
<br/>
My health, and friends, and parents dear,<br/>
To me by God are giv’n;<br/>
I have not any blessing here<br/>
But what is sent from Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
Such goodness, Lord, and constant care<br/>
I never can repay;<br/>
But may it be my daily prayer,<br/>
To love Thee and obey.<br/>
