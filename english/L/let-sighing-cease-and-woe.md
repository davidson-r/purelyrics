<br/>
Let sighing cease and woe<br/>
God from on high hath heard,<br/>
Heaven’s gate is opening wide, and lo!<br/>
The long expected Word.<br/>
<br/>
Peace! through the deep of night<br/>
The heavenly choir breaks forth,<br/>
Singing, with festal songs and bright,<br/>
Our God and Savior’s birth.<br/>
<br/>
The cave of Bethlehem<br/>
Those wakeful shepherds seek;<br/>
Let us too rise and greet with them<br/>
That infant pure and meek.<br/>
<br/>
We enter at the door<br/>
What marvel meets the eye?<br/>
A crib, a mother pale and poor,<br/>
A child of poverty.<br/>
<br/>
Art Thou the eternal Son,<br/>
The eternal Father’s ray?<br/>
Whose little hand, Thou infant one,<br/>
Doth lift the world alway?<br/>
<br/>
Yea faith through that dim cloud,<br/>
Like lightning darts before,<br/>
And greets Thee, at Whose footstool bowed<br/>
Heaven’s trembling hosts adore.<br/>
<br/>
Chaste be our love like Thine,<br/>
Our swelling souls bring low,<br/>
And in our hearts, O Babe divine<br/>
Be born, abide and grow.<br/>
<br/>
So shall Thy birthday morn,<br/>
Lord Christ, our birthday be,<br/>
Then greet we all, ourselves newborn,<br/>
Our King’s nativity.<br/>
