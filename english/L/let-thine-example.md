title: Let Thine Example

<center>
Let thine example, holy John, remind us,<br/>
Ere we can meetly sing thy deeds of wonder,<br/>
Hearts must be chastened, and the bonds that bind us<br/>
Broken asunder!<br/>
<br/>
Lo! a swift angel, from the skies descending,<br/>
Tells to thy father what shall be thy naming;<br/>
All thy lifeâ€™s greatness to its bitter ending<br/>
Duly proclaiming.<br/>
<br/>
But when he doubted what the angel told him<br/>
Came to him dumbness to confirm the story;<br/>
At thine appearing, healed again behold him,<br/>
Chanting thy glory!<br/>
<br/>
Oh! what a splendor and a revelation<br/>
Came to each mother, at thy joyful leaping,<br/>
Greeting thy Monarch, King of every nation,<br/>
In the womb sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
Angels in orders everlasting praise Thee,<br/>
God, in Thy triune majesty tremendous,<br/>
Hark to the prayers we, penitents, upraise Thee:<br/>
Save and defend us.
