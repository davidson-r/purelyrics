title: Lo From The Desert Homes

<br/>
Lo! from the desert homes<br/>
Where he hath hid so long,<br/>
The new Elias comes,<br/>
In sternest wisdom strong;<br/>
The voice that cries<br/>
Of Christ on high,<br/>
And judgment nigh<br/>
From opening skies.<br/>
<br/>
Your God e’en now doth stand<br/>
At Heaven’s opening door;<br/>
His fan is in His hand,<br/>
And He will purge His floor;<br/>
The wheat He claims<br/>
And with Him stows,<br/>
The chaff He throws<br/>
To quenchless flames.<br/>
<br/>
Ye haughty mountains, bow<br/>
Your sky-aspiring heads;<br/>
Ye valleys, hiding low,<br/>
Lift up your gentle meads;<br/>
Make His way plain<br/>
Your king before,<br/>
For evermore<br/>
He comes to reign.<br/>
<br/>
May Thy dread voice around,<br/>
Thou harbinger of Light,<br/>
On our dull ears still sound,<br/>
Lest here we sleep in night,<br/>
Till judgment come,<br/>
And on our path<br/>
Shall burst the wrath<br/>
And deathless doom.<br/>
<br/>
O God, with love’s sweet might,<br/>
Who dost anoint and arm<br/>
Christ’s soldier for the fight,<br/>
With grace that shields from harm,<br/>
Thrice blessèd Three<br/>
Heav’n’s endless days<br/>
Shall sing Thy praise<br/>
Eternally.<br/>
