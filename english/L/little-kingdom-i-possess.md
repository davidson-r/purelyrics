title: Little Kingdom I Possess

<br/>
A little kingdom I possess,<br/>
Where thoughts and feelings dwell,<br/>
And very hard I find the task<br/>
Of governing it well;<br/>
For passion tempts and troubles me,<br/>
A wayward will misleads,<br/>
And selfishness its shadow casts,<br/>
On all my will and deeds.<br/>
<br/>
How can I learn to rule myself,<br/>
To be the child I should,<br/>
Honest and brave, nor ever tire<br/>
Of trying to be good?<br/>
How can I keep a sunny soul<br/>
To shine along lifeâ€™s way?<br/>
How can I tune my little heart,<br/>
To sweetly sing all day?<br/>
<br/>
Dear Father, help me with the love<br/>
That castest out my fear!<br/>
Teach me to lean on Thee and feel<br/>
That thou art very near.<br/>
That no temptation is unseen,<br/>
No childish grief too small,<br/>
Since Thou, with patience infinite,<br/>
Dost soothe and comfort all.<br/>
<br/>
I do not ask for any crown<br/>
But that which all may win;<br/>
Nor try to conquer any world<br/>
Except the one within.<br/>
Be Thou my Guide until I find,<br/>
Led by a tender hand,<br/>
Thy happy kingdom in myself<br/>
And dare to take command.<br/>
