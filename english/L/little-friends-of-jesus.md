title: Little Friends Of Jesus

<center>
We are little children, very young indeed,<br/>
But the Savior’s promise each of us may plead.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
If we seek Him early, if we come today,<br/>
We can be His little friends, He has said we may.<br/>
<br/>
Little friends of Jesus, what a happy thought!<br/>
Was a precious promise in the Bible taught!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Little friends of Jesus, walking by His side,<br/>
With His arm around us, every step to guide.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We must love Him dearly with a constant love,<br/>
Then we’ll go and see Him in our home above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
