<br/>
Lo! Now is our accepted day,<br/>
The time for purging sins away,<br/>
The sins of thought, and deed, and word,<br/>
That we have done against the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
For He the Merciful and True<br/>
Hath spared His people hitherto;<br/>
Not willing that the soul should die,<br/>
Though great its past iniquity.<br/>
<br/>
Then let us all with earnest care,<br/>
And contrite fast, and tear and prayer,<br/>
And works of mercy and of love,<br/>
Entreat for pardon from above;<br/>
<br/>
That He may all our sins efface,<br/>
Adorn us with the gifts of grace,<br/>
And join us to the angel band,<br/>
Forever in the heavenly land.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Three in One and One in Three,<br/>
Almighty God, we pray to Thee,<br/>
That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless<br/>
Our fast with fruits of righteousness.<br/>
