<br/>
Lo! golden light rekindles day:<br/>
Let paling darkness steal away,<br/>
Which all too long o’erwhelmed our gaze<br/>
And led our steps by winding ways.<br/>
<br/>
We pray Thee, rising Light serene,<br/>
E’en as Thyself our hearts make clean;<br/>
Let no deceit our lips defile,<br/>
Nor let our souls be vexed by guile.<br/>
<br/>
O keep us, as the hours proceed,<br/>
From lying word and evil deed;<br/>
Our roving eyes from sin set free,<br/>
Our body from impurity.<br/>
<br/>
For Thou dost from above survey<br/>
The converse of each fleeting day;<br/>
Thou dost foresee from morning light<br/>
Our every deed, until the night.<br/>
<br/>
All laud to the God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To God the holy Paraclete.<br/>
