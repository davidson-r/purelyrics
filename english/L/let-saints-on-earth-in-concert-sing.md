<br/>
Let saints on earth in concert sing<br/>
With those whose work is done;<br/>
For all the servants of our King<br/>
In Heav’n and earth are one.<br/>
<br/>
One family, we dwell in Him,<br/>
One Church, above, beneath;<br/>
Though now divided by the stream,<br/>
The narrow stream of death.<br/>
<br/>
One army of the living God,<br/>
To His command we bow;<br/>
Part of the host have crossed the flood,<br/>
And part are crossing now.<br/>
<br/>
E’en now to their eternal home<br/>
There pass some spirits blest;<br/>
While others to the margin come,<br/>
Waiting their call to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, be Thou our constant Guide;<br/>
Then, when the word is given,<br/>
Bid Jordan’s narrow stream divide,<br/>
And bring us safe to Heav’n.<br/>
