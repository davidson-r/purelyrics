title: Light Of The World We Hail Thee

<center>
Light of the world, we hail Thee, flushing the eastern skies;<br/>
Never shall darkness veil Thee again from human eyes;<br/>
Too long, alas, withholden, now spread from shore to shore;<br/>
Thy light, so glad and golden, shall set on earth no more.<br/>
<br/>
Light of the world, Thy beauty steals into every heart,<br/>
And glorifies with duty life’s poorest, humblest, part;<br/>
Thou robest in Thy splendor the simple ways of men,<br/>
And helpest them to render light back to Thee again.<br/>
<br/>
Light of the world, before Thee our spirits prostrate fall;<br/>
We worship, we adore Thee, Thou Light, the Life of all;<br/>
With Thee is no forgetting of all Thine hand hath made;<br/>
Thy rising hath no setting, Thy sunshine hath no shade.<br/>
<br/>
Light of the world, illumine this darkened earth of Thine,<br/>
Till everything that’s human be filled with what’s divine;<br/>
Till every tongue and nation, from sin’s dominion free,<br/>
Rise in the new creation which springs from love and Thee.
