<br/>
Leave, shepherds, leave your peaceful flocks agrazing!<br/>
No longer grieve, but come, O come away!<br/>
Come and adore, your tears all changed to praising;<br/>
Of Him the heav’nly King, O sing, O sing<br/>
Your Savior born this happy day.<br/>
<br/>
There, lowly laid, within a manger narrow,<br/>
A lovely maid and Infant thou shalt see!<br/>
His tender love hath sought thee in thy sorrow<br/>
Thy darkness to remove! He came, to prove<br/>
A loving Shepherd’s care for thee!<br/>
<br/>
Kings from the east! His star will guide thee truly!<br/>
Where He doth rest, in love and faith draw near:<br/>
Our rising Sun receives thy homage duly!<br/>
O bring to Him, each one Each one! Each one!<br/>
Your incense and your gold and myrrh!<br/>
<br/>
Who canst do all things surely, hearts enshrine<br/>
Thine ardors sweet and fair! For peace is his<br/>
For peace is His that through Thee liveth purely!<br/>
And added unto this, all joy, and bliss<br/>
Since God hath sent His Savior here!<br/>
