The Lord of life is risen;<br/>
Sing, Easter heralds, sing!<br/>
He bursts His rocky prison;<br/>
Wide let the triumph ring!<br/>
In death no longer lying,<br/>
He rose, the Prince, today;<br/>
Life of the dead and dying,<br/>
He triumphed o’er decay.<br/>
<br/>
The Lord of life is risen,<br/>
And love no longer grieves;<br/>
In ruin lies death’s prison,<br/>
Sing, heralds, Jesus lives!<br/>
We hear the blessèd greeting;<br/>
Salvation’s work is done!<br/>
We worship Thee, repeating,<br/>
“Life for the dead is won!”<br/>
<br/>
Around Thy tomb, O Jesus,<br/>
How sweet the Easter breath;<br/>
Hear we not in the breezes,<br/>
“Where is thy sting, O death?”<br/>
Dark hell flies in commotion,<br/>
The heavens their anthems sing;<br/>
While far o’er earth and ocean<br/>
Glad hallelujahs ring!<br/>
<br/>
O publish this salvation,<br/>
Ye heralds, through the earth,<br/>
To every buried nation<br/>
Proclaim the day of birth!<br/>
Till, rising from their slumbers,<br/>
In long and ancient night<br/>
The countless heathen numbers<br/>
Shall hail the Easter light.<br/>
<br/>
Hail, hail, our Jesus risen!<br/>
Sing, ransomed brethren, sing!<br/>
Through death’s dark, gloomy prison<br/>
Let Easter chorals ring!<br/>
Haste, haste, ye captive legions,<br/>
Accept your glad reprieve;<br/>
Come forth from sin’s dark regions;<br/>
In Jesus’ kingdom live!
