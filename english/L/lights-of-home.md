<br/>
O the friends that now are waiting,<br/>
In the cloudless realms of day,<br/>
Who are calling me to follow<br/>
Where their steps have led the way;<br/>
They have laid aside their armor,<br/>
And their earthly course is run;<br/>
They have kept the faith with patience<br/>
And their crown of life is won.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
They are calling, gently calling,<br/>
Sweetly calling me to come,<br/>
And I’m looking through the shadows<br/>
For the blessèd lights of home.<br/>
<br/>
They have laid aside their armor<br/>
For the robe of spotless white;<br/>
And with Jesus they are walking<br/>
Where the river sparkles bright.<br/>
We have labored here together,<br/>
We have labored side by side,<br/>
Just a little while before me<br/>
They have crossed the rolling tide.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
On those dear familiar faces<br/>
There will be no trace of care;<br/>
Every sigh was hushed forever<br/>
At the palace gate so fair.<br/>
I shall see them, I shall know them,<br/>
I shall hear their song of love,<br/>
And we’ll all sing hallelujah<br/>
In our Father’s house above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
