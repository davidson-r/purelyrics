<br/>
The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.<br/>
He maketh me down to lie<br/>
In pastures green He leadeth me<br/>
The quiet waters by.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
His yoke is easy; His burden is light.<br/>
I’ve found it so; I’ve found it so.<br/>
He leadeth me by day and by night<br/>
Where living waters flow.<br/>
<br/>
My soul crieth out: “Restore me again,<br/>
And give me the strength to take<br/>
The narrow path of righteousness,<br/>
E’en for His own Name’s sake.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yea, tho’ I should walk the valley of death,<br/>
Yet why should I fear from ill?<br/>
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod<br/>
And staff me comfort still.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
