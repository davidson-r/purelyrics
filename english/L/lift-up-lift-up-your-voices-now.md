Lift up, lift up your voices now!<br/>
The whole wide world rejoices now;<br/>
The Lord has triumphed gloriously,<br/>
The Lord shall reign victoriously.<br/>
<br/>
In vain with stone the cave they barred;<br/>
In vain the watch kept ward and guard;<br/>
Majestic from the spoil√®d tomb,<br/>
In pomp of triumph Christ is come.<br/>
<br/>
And all He did, and all He bare,<br/>
He gives us as our own to share;<br/>
And hope, and joy and peace begin,<br/>
For Christ has won, and man shall win.<br/>
<br/>
O Victor, aid us in the fight,<br/>
And lead through death to realms of light;<br/>
We safely pass where Thou hast trod;<br/>
In Thee we die to rise to God.<br/>
<br/>
Thy flock, from sin and death set free,<br/>
Glad alleluias raise to Thee;<br/>
And ever with the heavenly host<br/>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
