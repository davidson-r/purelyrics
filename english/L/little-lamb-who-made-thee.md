Little lamb, who made thee?<br/>
Dost thou know who made thee,<br/>
Gave thee life, and bade thee feed<br/>
By the stream and o’er the mead;<br/>
Gave thee clothing of delight,<br/>
Softest clothing, wooly, bright;<br/>
Gave thee such a tender voice,<br/>
Making all the vales rejoice?<br/>
Little lamb, who made thee?<br/>
Dost thou know who made thee?<br/>
<br/>
Little lamb, I’ll tell thee;<br/>
Little lamb, I’ll tell thee:<br/>
He is called by thy name,<br/>
For He calls Himself a lamb,<br/>
He is meek, and He is mild,<br/>
He became a little child;<br/>
I a child, and Thee a Lamb,<br/>
We are called by His Name.<br/>
Little lamb, God bless thee!<br/>
Little lamb, God bless thee!
