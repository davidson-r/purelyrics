Lord, Who throughout these forty days<br/>
For us didst fast and pray,<br/>
Teach us with Thee to mourn our sins<br/>
And close by Thee to stay.<br/>
<br/>
As Thou with Satan didst contend,<br/>
And didst the victory win,<br/>
O give us strength in Thee to fight,<br/>
In Thee to conquer sin.<br/>
<br/>
As Thou didst hunger bear, and thirst,<br/>
So teach us, gracious Lord,<br/>
To die to self, and chiefly live<br/>
By Thy most holy Word.<br/>
<br/>
And through these days of penitence,<br/>
And through Thy passiontide,<br/>
Yea, evermore in life and death,<br/>
Jesus, with us abide.<br/>
<br/>
Abide with us, that so, this life<br/>
Of suffering over past,<br/>
An Easter of unending joy<br/>
We may attain at last.
