<br/>
Lamp of our feet whereby we trace<br/>
Our path when wont to stray;<br/>
Stream from the fount of heav’nly grace,<br/>
Brook by the traveler’s way.<br/>
<br/>
Bread of our souls whereon we feed,<br/>
True manna from on high;<br/>
Our guide and chart wherein we read<br/>
Of realms beyond the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Pillar of fire, through watches dark,<br/>
Or radiant cloud by day;<br/>
When waves would break our tossing bark,<br/>
Our anchor and our stay.<br/>
<br/>
Word of the ever living God,<br/>
Will of His glorious Son;<br/>
Without Thee, how could earth be trod<br/>
Or Heav’n itself be won?<br/>
<br/>
Yet to unfold thy hidden worth,<br/>
Thy mysteries to reveal,<br/>
That Spirit which first gave thee forth,<br/>
Thy volume must unseal.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, grant us all aright to learn<br/>
The wisdom it imparts<br/>
And to its heavenly teaching turn<br/>
With simple, childlike hearts.<br/>
