<br/>
Lord Jesus, God and Man,<br/>
For love of man a Child,<br/>
The very God, yet born on earth<br/>
Of Mary undefiled.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus, God and Man,<br/>
In this our festal day<br/>
To Thee for precious gifts of grace<br/>
Thy ransomed people pray.<br/>
<br/>
We pray for childlike hearts,<br/>
For gentle, holy love,<br/>
For strength to do Thy will below<br/>
As angels do above.<br/>
<br/>
We pray for simple faith,<br/>
For hope that never fails,<br/>
For true communion evermore<br/>
With all Thy bless√®d saints.<br/>
<br/>
On friends around us here<br/>
O let Thy blessing fall;<br/>
We pray for grace to love them well,<br/>
But Thee beyond them all.<br/>
<br/>
O joy to live for Thee!<br/>
O joy in Thee to die!<br/>
O very joy of joys to see<br/>
Thy face eternally!<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus, God and Man,<br/>
We praise Thee and adore,<br/>
Who art with God the Father One,<br/>
And Spirit evermore.<br/>
