<center>
Learning how to fight<br/>
Keeping Christ in sight,<br/>
We are singing, joy-bells ringing,<br/>
Marching in the light.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Training, learning,<br/>
Godâ€™s dear will to do;<br/>
Singing, clinging,<br/>
Little soldiers true.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus is our Guide,<br/>
He is at our side;<br/>
He defends us, courage lends us,<br/>
True we shall abide.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
If we conquer sin,<br/>
Keeping pure within,<br/>
Winning glory with His story,<br/>
Life-crown we shall win.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In a happy place,<br/>
With the saved by grace,<br/>
Carols raising, Jesus praising,<br/>
We shall see His face.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
