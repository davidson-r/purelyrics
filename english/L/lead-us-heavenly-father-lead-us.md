title: Lead Us Heavenly Father Lead Us

<center>
Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us<br/>
O'er the world's tempestuos sea;<br/>
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,<br/>
For we have no help but thee;<br/>
Yet possessing every blessing<br/>
If our God our Father be.<br/>
<br/>
Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us,<br/>
All our weakness thou dost know;<br/>
Thou didst tread this earth before us,<br/>
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;<br/>
Self denying, death defying,<br/>
Thou to Calvary didst go.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit of our God, descending,<br/>
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy;<br/>
Love with every passion blending,<br/>
Pleasure that can never cloy;<br/>
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,<br/>
Nothing can our peace destroy.
