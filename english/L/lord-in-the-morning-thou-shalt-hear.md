<center>
Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear<br/>
My voice ascending high;<br/>
To Thee will I direct my prayer,<br/>
To Thee lift up mine eye.<br/>
<br/>
Up to the hills, where Christ is gone<br/>
To plead for all His saints,<br/>
Presenting at His Father’s throne,<br/>
Our songs and our complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art a God before Whose sight<br/>
The wicked shall not stand;<br/>
Sinners shall ne’er be Thy delight,<br/>
Nor dwell at Thy right hand.<br/>
<br/>
But to Thy house will I resort,<br/>
To taste Thy mercies there;<br/>
I will frequent Thine holy court,<br/>
And worship in Thy fear.<br/>
<br/>
O may Thy Spirit guide my feet<br/>
In ways of righteousness!<br/>
Make ev’ry path of duty straight<br/>
And plain before my face<br/>
<br/>
My watchful enemies combine<br/>
To tempt my feet astray;<br/>
They flatter, with a base design<br/>
To make my soul their prey.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, crush the serpent in the dust,<br/>
And all his plots destroy;<br/>
While those that in Thy mercy trust,<br/>
Forever shout for joy.<br/>
<br/>
The men that love and fear Thy Name<br/>
Shall see their hopes fulfill’d;<br/>
The mighty God will compass them<br/>
With favor as a shield.
</center>
