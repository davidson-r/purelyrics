<center>
Lift up your heads, rejoice, redemption draweth nigh;<br/>
Now breathes a softer air, now shines a milder sky;<br/>
The early trees put forth their new and tender leaf;<br/>
Hushed is the moaning wind that told of winter’s grief.<br/>
<br/>
Lift up your heads, rejoice, redemption draweth nigh;<br/>
Now mount the laden clouds, now flames the darkening sky;<br/>
The early scattered drops descend with heavy fall,<br/>
And to the waiting earth the hidden thunders call.<br/>
<br/>
Lift up your heads, rejoice, redemption draweth nigh;<br/>
O note the varying signs of earth, and air, and sky;<br/>
The God of glory comes in gentleness and might,<br/>
To comfort and alarm, to succor and to smite.<br/>
<br/>
He comes, the wide world’s King, He comes, the true heart’s Friend,<br/>
New gladness to begin, and ancient wrong to end;<br/>
He comes, to fill with light the weary waiting eye;<br/>
Lift up your heads, rejoice, redemption draweth nigh.
