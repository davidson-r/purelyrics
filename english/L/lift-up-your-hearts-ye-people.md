title: Lift Up Your Hearts Ye People

<center>
Lift up your hearts, ye people,<br/>
In songs of glad accord,<br/>
And in your adoration<br/>
Praise Christ, your risen Lord.<br/>
For He hath won the victory,<br/>
O’er sin and death’s dark night,<br/>
And filled the gloom and darkness<br/>
With resurrection light.<br/>
<br/>
Now let the earth be joyful<br/>
In springtime’s bright array,<br/>
Let hearts downcast and lonely<br/>
Rejoice this Easter day;<br/>
The grave hast lost its triumph,<br/>
And death has lost its sting,<br/>
O, sing in exultation<br/>
To Christ, your risen King!
