<br/>
O land of my fathers, O land of my love,<br/>
Dear mother of minstrels who kindle and move,<br/>
And hero on hero, who at honour's proud call,<br/>
For freedom their lifeblood let fall.<br/>
<br/>
Wales! Wales! O but my heart is with you! <br/>
And long as the sea <br/>
Your bulwark shall be, <br/>
To Cymru my heart shall be true. <br/>
<br/>
O land of the mountains, the bard's paradise,<br/>
Whose precipice, valleys lone as the skies,<br/>
Green murmuring forest, far echoing flood<br/>
Fire the fancy and quicken the blood.<br/>
<br/>
For tho' the fierce foeman has ravaged your realm,<br/>
The old speech of Cymru he cannot o'erwhelm,<br/>
Our passionate poets to silence command<br/>
Or banish the harp from your strand.<br/>
