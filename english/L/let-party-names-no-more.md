<br/>
Let party names no more<br/>
The Christian world oâ€™erspread;<br/>
Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,<br/>
Are one in Christ, their Head.<br/>
<br/>
Among the saints on earth<br/>
Let mutual love be found,<br/>
Heirs of the same inheritance<br/>
With mutual blessings crowned.<br/>
<br/>
Let envy, child of hell!<br/>
Be banished far away:<br/>
Those should in strictest friendship dwell<br/>
Who the same Lord obey.<br/>
<br/>
Thus will the church below<br/>
Resemble that above,<br/>
Where streams of pleasure ever flow,<br/>
And every heart is love.<br/>
