title: Lord When Thy Kingdom Comes

<br/>
“Lord, when Thy kingdom comes, remember me”;<br/>
Thus spake the dying lips to dying ears;<br/>
O faith, which in that darkest hour could see<br/>
The promised glory of the far off years!<br/>
<br/>
No kingly sign declares that glory now,<br/>
No ray of hope lights up that awful hour;<br/>
A thorny crown surrounds the bleeding brow,<br/>
The hands are stretched in weakness, not in power.<br/>
<br/>
Yet hear the word the dying Savior saith,<br/>
“Thou too shalt rest in Paradise today”;<br/>
O words of love to answer words of faith!<br/>
O words of hope for those who live to pray!<br/>
<br/>
Lord, when with dying lips my prayer is said,<br/>
Grant that in faith Thy kingdom I may see;<br/>
And, thinking on Thy cross and bleeding head,<br/>
May breathe my parting words, “Remember me.”<br/>
<br/>
Remember me, but not my shame or sin;<br/>
Thy cleansing blood hath washed them all away;<br/>
Thy precious death for me did pardon win;<br/>
Thy blood redeemed me in that awful day.<br/>
<br/>
Remember me, yet how canst Thou forget<br/>
What pain and anguish I have caused to Thee,<br/>
The cross, the agony, the bloody sweat,<br/>
And all the sorrow Thou didst bear for me?<br/>
<br/>
Remember me, and, ere I pass away,<br/>
Speak Thou th’assuring word that sets us free,<br/>
And make Thy promise to my heart, “Today<br/>
Thou too shalt rest in Paradise with Me.”<br/>
