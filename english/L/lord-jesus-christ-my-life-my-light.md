<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,<br/>
My Strength by day, my Trust by night,<br/>
On earth I’m but a passing guest<br/>
And sorely with my sins oppressed.<br/>
<br/>
Far off I see my Fatherland,<br/>
Where through Thy blood I hope to stand.<br/>
But ere I reach that paradise,<br/>
A weary way before me lies.<br/>
<br/>
My heart sinks at the journey’s length,<br/>
My wasted flesh and little strength;<br/>
My soul alone still cries in me:<br/>
“Lord, take me home, take me to Thee!”<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let Thy sufferings give me power<br/>
To meet the last and darkest hour!<br/>
Thy blood refresh and comfort me;<br/>
Thy bonds and fetters make me free.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let Thy holy wounds for me<br/>
Clefts in the rock forever be<br/>
Where as a dove my soul can hide<br/>
And safe from Satan’s rage abide.<br/>
<br/>
And when my spirit flies away,<br/>
Thy dying words shall be my stay.<br/>
Thy cross shall be my staff in life,<br/>
Thy holy grave my rest from strife.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, in Thy nail prints let me read<br/>
That Thou to save me hast decreed<br/>
And grant that in Thine opened side<br/>
My troubled soul may ever hide.<br/>
<br/>
Since Thou hast died, the Pure, the Just,<br/>
I take my homeward way in trust.<br/>
The gates of Heav’n, Lord, open wide<br/>
When here I may no more abide.<br/>
<br/>
And when the last great day shall come<br/>
And Thou, our Judge, shalt speak the doom,<br/>
Let me with joy behold the light<br/>
And set me then upon Thy right.<br/>
<br/>
Renew this wasted flesh of mine<br/>
That like the sun it there may shine<br/>
Among the angels pure and bright,<br/>
Yea, like Thyself in glorious light.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, then I’ll have my heart’s desire,<br/>
When, singing with the angels’ choir,<br/>
Among the ransomed of Thy grace,<br/>
Forever I’ll behold Thy face!<br/>
