<br/>
Lord, we thank Thee for the pleasure<br/>
That our happy lifetime gives,<br/>
For the boundless worth and treasure<br/>
Of a soul that ever lives;<br/>
Mind that looks before and after,<br/>
Lifting eyes to things above;<br/>
Human tears, and human laughter,<br/>
And the depths of human love.<br/>
<br/>
For the thrill, the leap, the gladness<br/>
Of our pulses flowing free;<br/>
E’en for every touch of sadness<br/>
That may bring us nearer Thee;<br/>
But, above all other kindness,<br/>
Thine unutterable love,<br/>
Which, to heal our sin and blindness,<br/>
Sent Thy dear Son from above.<br/>
<br/>
Teach us so our days to number<br/>
That we may be early wise;<br/>
Dreamy mist, or cloud, or slumber,<br/>
Never dull our heav’nward eyes.<br/>
Hearty be our work and willing,<br/>
As to Thee, and not to men;<br/>
For we know our soul’s fulfilling<br/>
Is in Heav’n, and not ’til then.<br/>
