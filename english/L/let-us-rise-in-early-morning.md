title: Let Us Rise In Early Morning

<br/>
Let us rise in early morning,<br/>
And, instead of ointments, bring<br/>
Hymns of praises to our Master,<br/>
And His Resurrection sing:<br/>
We shall see the Sun of Justice<br/>
Ris’n with healing on His wing,<br/>
Ris’n with healing on His wing.<br/>
<br/>
Thy unbounded loving-kindness,<br/>
They that groaned in Hades’ chain,<br/>
Prisoners, from afar beholding,<br/>
Hasten to the light again<br/>
And to that eternal Pascha<br/>
Wove the dance and raised the strain,<br/>
Wove the dance and raised the strain.<br/>
<br/>
Go ye forth, His saints, to meet Him!<br/>
Go with lamps in every hand!<br/>
From the sepulcher He riseth:<br/>
Ready for the Bridegroom stand:<br/>
And the Pascha of salvation<br/>
Hail, with His triumphant band,<br/>
Hail, with His triumphant band.<br/>
