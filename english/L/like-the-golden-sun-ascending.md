<br/>
Like the golden sun ascending,<br/>
Breaking through the gloom of night,<br/>
On the earth His glory spending<br/>
So that darkness takes to flight,<br/>
Thus my Jesus from the grave<br/>
And death’s dismal, dreadful cave<br/>
Rose triumphant Easter morning<br/>
At the early purple dawning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Thee, O Christ victorious!<br/>
Thanks to Thee, O Lord of Life!<br/>
Death hath now no power o’er us,<br/>
Thou hast conquered in the strife.<br/>
Thanks because Thou didst arise<br/>
And hast opened Paradise!<br/>
None can fully sing the glory<br/>
Of the resurrection story.<br/>
<br/>
Though I be by sin o’ertaken,<br/>
Though I lie in helplessness,<br/>
Though I be by friends forsaken<br/>
And must suffer sore distress,<br/>
Though I be despised, contemned,<br/>
And by all the world condemned,<br/>
Though the dark grave yawn before me,<br/>
Yet the light of hope shines o’er me.<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast died for my transgression,<br/>
All my sins on Thee were laid;<br/>
Thou hast won for me salvation,<br/>
On the cross my debt was paid.<br/>
From the grave I shall arise<br/>
And shall meet Thee in the skies.<br/>
Death itself is transitory;<br/>
I shall lift my head in glory.<br/>
<br/>
Grant me grace, O blessèd Savior,<br/>
And Thy Holy Spirit send<br/>
That my walk and my behavior<br/>
May be pleasing to the end;<br/>
That I may not fall again<br/>
Into death’s grim pit and pain,<br/>
Whence by grace Thou hast retrieved me<br/>
And from which Thou hast relieved me.<br/>
<br/>
For the joy Thy advent gave me,<br/>
For Thy holy, precious Word;<br/>
For Thy baptism, which doth save me,<br/>
For Thy blest communion board;<br/>
For Thy death, the bitter scorn,<br/>
For Thy resurrection morn,<br/>
Lord, I thank Thee and extol Thee,<br/>
And in heaven I shall behold Thee.<br/>
