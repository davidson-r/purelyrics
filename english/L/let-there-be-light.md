title: Let There Be Light

<br/>
Let there be light, Lord God of hosts,<br/>
Let there be wisdom on the earth;<br/>
Let broad humanity have birth,<br/>
Let there be deeds, instead of boasts.<br/>
<br/>
Within our passioned hearts instill<br/>
The calm that endeth strain and strife;<br/>
Make us thy ministers of life;<br/>
Purge us from lusts that curse and kill.<br/>
<br/>
Give us the peace of vision clear<br/>
To see our brothersâ€™ good our own,<br/>
To joy and suffer not alone,<br/>
The love that casteth out all fear.<br/>
<br/>
Let woe and waste of warfare cease,<br/>
That useful labor yet may build<br/>
Its homes with love and laughter filled;<br/>
God give thy wayward children peace.<br/>
