<center>
Lord of all being, thronèd afar,<br/>
Thy glory flames from sun and star;<br/>
Center and soul of every sphere,<br/>
Yet to each loving heart how near!<br/>
<br/>
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray,<br/>
Sheds on our path the glow of day;<br/>
Star of our hope, Thy softened light<br/>
Cheers the long watches of the night.<br/>
<br/>
Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;<br/>
Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;<br/>
Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy’s sign;<br/>
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Lord of all life, below, above,<br/>
Whose light is truth, Whose warmth is love,<br/>
Before Thy ever blazing throne<br/>
We ask no luster of our own.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us Thy truth to make us free,<br/>
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee,<br/>
Till all Thy living altars claim<br/>
One holy light, one heavenly flame.
