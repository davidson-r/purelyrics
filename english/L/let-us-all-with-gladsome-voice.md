Let us all with with gladsome voice<br/>
Praise the God of Heaven,<br/>
Who, to bid our hearts rejoice,<br/>
His own Son hath given.<br/>
<br/>
To this vale of tears He comes,<br/>
Here to serve in sadness,<br/>
That with Him in Heavâ€™ns fair home<br/>
We may reign in gladness.<br/>
<br/>
We are rich, for He was poor;<br/>
Is not this a wonder?<br/>
Therefore praise God evermore<br/>
Here on earth and yonder.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord Christ, our Savior dear,<br/>
Be Thou ever near us.<br/>
Grant us now a glad new year.<br/>
Amen, Jesus, hear us!
