Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,<br/>
Till all the world adore His sacred Name.<br/>
<br/>
Led on their way by this triumphant sign,<br/>
The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Each newborn servant of the Crucified<br/>
Bears on the brow the seal of Him Who died.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,<br/>
As Thou hast promised, draw the world to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So shall our song of triumph ever be:<br/>
Praise to the Crucified for victory.<br/>
<br/>
