<br/>
Lord, Who at Cana’s wedding feast<br/>
Didst as a Guest appear,<br/>
Thou dearer far than earthly guest,<br/>
Vouchsafe Thy presence here.<br/>
For holy Thou indeed dost prove<br/>
The marriage vow to be,<br/>
Proclaiming it a type of love<br/>
Between the Church and Thee.<br/>
<br/>
This holy vow that man can make,<br/>
The golden thread in life,<br/>
The bond that none may dare to break,<br/>
That bindeth man and wife,<br/>
Which, blest by Thee, whate’er betide,<br/>
No evil shall destroy,<br/>
Through careworn days each care divides<br/>
And doubles every joy.<br/>
<br/>
On those who now before Thee kneel,<br/>
O Lord, Thy blessing pour,<br/>
That each may wake the other’s zeal<br/>
To love Thee more and more.<br/>
Oh, grant them here in peace to live,<br/>
In purity and love,<br/>
And, this world leaving, to receive<br/>
A crown of life above.<br/>
