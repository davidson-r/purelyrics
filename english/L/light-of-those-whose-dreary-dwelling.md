title: Light Of Those Whose Dreary Dwelling

<center>
<br/>
Light of those whose dreary dwelling<br/>
Borders on the shades of death,<br/>
Come, and by Thy love’s revealing<br/>
Dissipate the clouds beneath.<br/>
<br/>
The new heaven and earth’s Creator,<br/>
In our deepest darkness rise,<br/>
Scattering all the night of nature,<br/>
Pouring eyesight on our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Still we wait for Thine appearing;<br/>
Life and joy Thy beams impart,<br/>
Chasing all our fears, and cheering<br/>
Every poor benighted heart.<br/>
<br/>
Come, and manifest the favor<br/>
God hath for our ransomed race;<br/>
Come, Thou universal Savior,<br/>
Come, and bring the Gospel grace.<br/>
<br/>
Save us in Thy great compassion,<br/>
O Thou mild, pacific Prince;<br/>
Give the knowledge of salvation,<br/>
Give the pardon of our sins.<br/>
<br/>
By Thine all-redeeming merit<br/>
Every burdened soul release;<br/>
Every weary, wandering spirit<br/>
Guide into Thy perfect peace.<br/>
