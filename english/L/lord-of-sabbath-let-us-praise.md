<br/>
The Lord of Sabbath let us praise,<br/>
In concert with the blest,<br/>
Who, joyful in harmonious lays,<br/>
Employ an endless rest.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Lord, while we remember Thee,<br/>
We blest and pious grow;<br/>
By hymns of praise we learn to be<br/>
Triumphant here below.<br/>
<br/>
On this glad day a brighter scene<br/>
Of glory was displayed,<br/>
By the eternal Word, than when<br/>
This universe was made.<br/>
<br/>
He rises, Who mankind has bought<br/>
With grief and pain extreme;<br/>
’Twas great to speak the world from naught;<br/>
’Twas greater to redeem.<br/>
