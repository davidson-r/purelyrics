<br/>
A little Child the Savior came,<br/>
The Mighty God was His Name;<br/>
And angels worshiped as He lay<br/>
The seeming Infant of a day.<br/>
<br/>
He Who, a little Child, began<br/>
The life divine to show to man,<br/>
Proclaims from Heav’n the message free;<br/>
“Let little children come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
We bring them, Lord, and with the sign<br/>
Of sprinkled water name them Thine;<br/>
Their souls with saving grace endow;<br/>
Baptize them with Thy Spirit now.<br/>
<br/>
O give Thine angels charge, good Lord,<br/>
Them safely in Thy way to guard;<br/>
Thy blessing on their lives command,<br/>
And write their names upon Thy hand.<br/>
<br/>
O Thou, Who by an infant’s tongue<br/>
Dost hear Thy perfect glory sung,<br/>
May these, with all the heav’nly host,<br/>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br/>
