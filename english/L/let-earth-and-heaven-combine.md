title: Let Earth and Heaven combine

<br/>
Let earth and heaven combine,<br/>
Angels and men agree,<br/>
To praise in songs divine<br/>
The incarnate Deity,<br/>
Our God contracted to a span,<br/>
Incomprehensibly made Man.<br/>
<br/>
He laid His glory by,<br/>
He wrapped Him in our clay;<br/>
Unmarked by human eye,<br/>
The latent Godhead lay;<br/>
Infant of days He here became,<br/>
And bore the mild Immanuel’s Name.<br/>
<br/>
Unsearchable the love<br/>
That has the Savior brought;<br/>
The grace is far above<br/>
Of men or angels’ thought:<br/>
Suffice for us that God, we know,<br/>
Our God, is manifest below.<br/>
<br/>
He deigns in flesh to appear,<br/>
Widest extremes to join;<br/>
To bring our vileness near,<br/>
And make us all divine:<br/>
And we the life of God shall know,<br/>
For God is manifest below.<br/>
<br/>
Made perfect first in love,<br/>
And sanctified by grace,<br/>
We shall from earth remove,<br/>
And see His glorious face:<br/>
His love shall then be fully showed,<br/>
And man shall all be lost in God.<br/>
