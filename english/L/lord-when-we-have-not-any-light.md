title: Lord When We Have Not Any Light

<center>
Lord, when we have not any light,<br/>
And mothers are asleep;<br/>
Then through the stillness of the night,<br/>
Thy little children keep.<br/>
<br/>
When shadows haunt the quiet room,<br/>
Help us to understand<br/>
That Thou art with us through the gloom,<br/>
To hold us by the hand.<br/>
<br/>
And though we do not always see<br/>
The holy angels near,<br/>
O may we trust ourselves to Thee,<br/>
Nor have one foolish fear.<br/>
<br/>
So in the morning may we wake,<br/>
When wakes the kindly sun,<br/>
More loving for our Fatherâ€™s sake<br/>
To each unloving one.
