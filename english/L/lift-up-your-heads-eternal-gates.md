<br/>
Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates;<br/>
Behold, the King of glory waits;<br/>
The King of kings is drawing near;<br/>
The Savior of the world is here!<br/>
<br/>
A Helper just He comes to thee,<br/>
His chariot is humility,<br/>
His kingly crown is holiness,<br/>
His scepter, pity in distress.<br/>
<br/>
O blest the land, the city blest,<br/>
Where Christ the Ruler is confessed!<br/>
O happy hearts and happy homes<br/>
To whom this King in triumph comes!<br/>
<br/>
Fling wide the portals of your heart;<br/>
Make it a temple, set apart<br/>
From earthly use for heavenâ€™s employ,<br/>
Adorned with prayer and love and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Redeemer, come, with us abide;<br/>
Our hearts to Thee we open wide;<br/>
Let us Thy inner presence feel;<br/>
Thy grace and love in us reveal.<br/>
<br/>
Thy Holy Spirit lead us on<br/>
Until our glorious goal is won;<br/>
Eternal praise, eternal fame<br/>
Be offered, Savior, to Thy Name!<br/>
