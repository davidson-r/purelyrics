Laurels, fresh laurels, for the Sunday School we bring;<br/>
They will bloom in fadeless verdure<br/>
Through a calm eternal spring;<br/>
Then gladly hail with a pure delight,<br/>
Oh, hail our beautiful wreath so bright;<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” for the Sunday School, for the Sunday School,<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” for the Sunday School we bring.<br/>
<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” for the Sunday School to wear;<br/>
All may win the precious garland,<br/>
All the flaming crown may wear;<br/>
The smile of hope and the dew of prayer,<br/>
Has made this beautiful wreath so fair.<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” for the Sunday School, for the Sunday School,<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” for the Sunday School to wear.<br/>
<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” then awake the song anew.<br/>
They will make you good and gentle,<br/>
You will love and praise them, too;<br/>
Oh, meet in heaven the heart so true,<br/>
That twined the beautiful wreath for you.<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” then awake the song, then awake the song.<br/>
Laurels, “Fresh Laurels,” then awake the song so new.
