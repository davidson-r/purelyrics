<br/>
Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free, <br/>
How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee? <br/>
Wider still, and wider, shall thy bounds be set; <br/>
God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet! <br/>
<br/>
Truth and Right and Freedom, each a holy gem, <br/>
Stars of solemn brightness, weave thy diadem. <br/>
<br/>
Tho' thy way be darkened, still in splendour drest, <br/>
As the star that trembles o'er the liquid West. <br/>
<br/>
Throned amid the billows, throned inviolate, <br/>
Thou hast reigned victorious, thou has smiled at fate. <br/>
<br/>
Land of Hope and Glory, fortress of the Free, <br/>
How may we extol thee, praise thee, honour thee? <br/>
<br/>
Hark, a mighty nation maketh glad reply; <br/>
Lo, our lips are thankful, lo, our hearts are high! <br/>
<br/>
Hearts in hope uplifted, loyal lips that sing; <br/>
Strong in faith and freedom, we have crowned our King!<br/>
