<br/>
Little children, rise and sing,<br/>
(Ring the bells of Christmas)<br/>
’Tis the birthday of our King,<br/>
Blessèd Child of Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
In a stable far away<br/>
(Ring the bells of Christmas)<br/>
Christ was born that happy day,<br/>
Blessèd Child of Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Joyful shepherds kneeling there,<br/>
(Ring the bells of Christmas)<br/>
Saw the Babe and said in prayer,<br/>
‘Blessèd Child of Christmas.’<br/>
<br/>
Bring your gifts to Mary’s Son<br/>
(Ring the bells of Christmas)<br/>
God’s own Gift to everyone;<br/>
Blessèd Child of Christmas.<br/>
