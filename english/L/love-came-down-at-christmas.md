<br/>
Love came down at Christmas,<br/>
Love all lovely, love divine;<br/>
Love was born at Christmas,<br/>
Star and angels gave the sign.<br/>
<br/>
Worship we the Godhead,<br/>
Love incarnate, love divine;<br/>
Worship we our Jesus:<br/>
But wherewith for sacred sign?<br/>
<br/>
Love shall be our token,<br/>
Love shall be yours and love be mine,<br/>
Love to God and to all men,<br/>
Love for plea and gift and sign.<br/>
