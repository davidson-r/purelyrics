<center>
Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing;<br/>
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;<br/>
Let us each Thy love possessing,<br/>
Triumph in redeeming grace.<br/>
O refresh us, O refresh us,<br/>
Traveling through this wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks we give and adoration<br/>
For Thy Gospelâ€™s joyful sound;<br/>
May the fruits of Thy salvation<br/>
In our hearts and lives abound.<br/>
Ever faithful, ever faithful,<br/>
To the truth may we be found.<br/>
<br/>
So that when Thy love shall call us,<br/>
Savior, from the world away,<br/>
Let no fear of death appall us,<br/>
Glad Thy summons to obey.<br/>
May we ever, may we ever,<br/>
Reign with Thee in endless day.
