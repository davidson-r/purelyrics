title: Let Little Children Come To Me

<center>
“Let little children come to Me,”<br/>
So says our blessèd Lord;<br/>
And I, a little child, must be<br/>
Obedient to His Word;<br/>
On Sabbath days must sing His praise,<br/>
And bow before Him, for He says,<br/>
“Let little children come to Me,<br/>
Let little children come.”<br/>
<br/>
“Let little children come to Me,”<br/>
It is my Savior’s call;<br/>
He spake it not to two or three,<br/>
But to the children all;<br/>
And so, when they His law obey,<br/>
It is as if they heard Him say,<br/>
“Let little children come to Me,<br/>
Let little children come.”<br/>
<br/>
“Let little children come to Me,”<br/>
O Father, Lord, I come;<br/>
Through life and death I’ll go with Thee,<br/>
Thine arms shall be my home.<br/>
I cannot fear when Thou art near;<br/>
And Thy sweet words I seem to hear,<br/>
“Let little children come to Me,<br/>
Let little children come.”
