<br/>
Let our choir new anthems raise, wake the morn with gladness;<br/>
God Himself to joy and praise turns the martyrs’ sadness:<br/>
Bright the day that won their crown, opened heav’ns bright portal,<br/>
As they laid the mortal down and put on th’immortal.<br/>
<br/>
Never flinched they from the flame, from the torture never;<br/>
Vain the foeman’s sharpest aim, Satan’s best endeavor:<br/>
For by faith they saw the land decked in all its glory,<br/>
Where triumphant now they stand with the victor’s story.<br/>
<br/>
Faith they had that knew not shame, love that could not languish;<br/>
And eternal hope o’ercame momentary anguish.<br/>
Up and follow, Christian men! Press through toil and sorrow;<br/>
Spurn the night of fear, and then, O the glorious morrow!<br/>
