<center>
Lo! He comes with clouds descending,<br/>
Once for favored sinners slain;<br/>
Thousand thousand saints attending,<br/>
Swell the triumph of His train:<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
God appears on earth to reign.<br/>
<br/>
Every eye shall now behold Him<br/>
Robed in dreadful majesty;<br/>
Those who set at naught and sold Him,<br/>
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br/>
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,<br/>
Shall the true Messiah see.<br/>
<br/>
Every island, sea, and mountain,<br/>
Heav’n and earth, shall flee away;<br/>
All who hate Him must, confounded,<br/>
Hear the trump proclaim the day:<br/>
Come to judgment! Come to judgment!<br/>
Come to judgment! Come away!<br/>
<br/>
Now redemption, long expected,<br/>
See in solemn pomp appear;<br/>
All His saints, by man rejected,<br/>
Now shall meet Him in the air:<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
See the day of God appear!<br/>
<br/>
Answer Thine own bride and Spirit,<br/>
Hasten, Lord, the general doom!<br/>
The new Heav’n and earth t’inherit,<br/>
Take Thy pining exiles home:<br/>
All creation, all creation,<br/>
Travails! groans! and bids Thee come!<br/>
<br/>
The dear tokens of His passion<br/>
Still His dazzling body bears;<br/>
Cause of endless exultation<br/>
To His ransomed worshippers;<br/>
With what rapture, with what rapture<br/>
Gaze we on those glorious scars!<br/>
<br/>
Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,<br/>
High on Thine eternal throne;<br/>
Savior, take the power and glory,<br/>
Claim the kingdom for Thine own;<br/>
O come quickly! O come quickly!<br/>
Everlasting God, come down!
