<br/>
Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br/>
Lead them to Thee,<br/>
These children dear of mine,<br/>
Thou gavest me.<br/>
O, by Thy love divine,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br/>
Lead them, lead them,<br/>
Lead them to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
When earth looks bright and fair,<br/>
Festive and gay,<br/>
Let no delusive snare,<br/>
Lure them away;<br/>
But from temptation’s power,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
E’en for such little ones,<br/>
Christ came a child,<br/>
And through this world of sin,<br/>
Movèd undefiled;<br/>
O, for His sake, I pray,<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yea, though my faith be dim,<br/>
I would believe<br/>
That Thou this precious gift,<br/>
Wilt now receive;<br/>
O, take their young hearts now;<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
