title: Lift Your Glad Voices

<br/>
Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,<br/>
For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die;<br/>
Vain were the terrors that gathered around Him,<br/>
And short the dominion of death and the grave;<br/>
He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound Him,<br/>
Resplendent in glory to live and to save!<br/>
Loud was the chorus of angels on high,<br/>
The Savior hath risen, and man shall not die.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God, in full anthems of joy;<br/>
The being He gave us death cannot destroy:<br/>
Sad were the life we must part with tomorrow,<br/>
If tears were our birthright, and death were our end;<br/>
But Jesus hath cheered the dark valley of sorrow,<br/>
And bade us, immortal, to Heaven ascend:<br/>
Lift then your voices in triumph on high,<br/>
For Jesus hath risen, and man shall not die.<br/>
