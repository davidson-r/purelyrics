title: Like As A Father

<br/>
When silent falls the gushing tear,<br/>
O’er cheeks grown pale with care;<br/>
And on the heart a cross is laid<br/>
That seems too hard to bear,<br/>
Remember what our Lord has said,<br/>
And trust, in weal or woe,<br/>
His holy Word, that changeth not,<br/>
Though uttered years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Like as a father pitieth His children,<br/>
So the Lord pitieth them that fear Him,<br/>
So the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.”<br/>
<br/>
When one by one our treasured hopes<br/>
Like autumn leaves decay,<br/>
And they who made our life most dear<br/>
Are borne from us away,<br/>
O look beyond the veil of time,<br/>
Where springs of comfort flow,<br/>
And trust His Word, that changeth not,<br/>
Though uttered years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The clouds that bode the darkest hour<br/>
The purest light may bring;<br/>
The heart that mourns its broken chords<br/>
The sweetest song may sing;<br/>
Though oft a rugged path we tread,<br/>
Yet this one thing we know,<br/>
God’s holy Word can never change,<br/>
Though uttered years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
