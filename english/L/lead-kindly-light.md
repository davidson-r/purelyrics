<br/>
Lead, kindly Light, amid th’encircling gloom, lead Thou me on!<br/>
The night is dark, and I am far from home; lead Thou me on!<br/>
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br/>
The distant scene; one step enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou shouldst lead me on;<br/>
I loved to choose and see my path; but now lead Thou me on!<br/>
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,<br/>
Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years!<br/>
<br/>
So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still will lead me on.<br/>
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till the night is gone,<br/>
And with the morn those angel faces smile, which I<br/>
Have loved long since, and lost awhile!<br/>
<br/>
Meantime, along the narrow rugged path, Thyself hast trod,<br/>
Lead, Savior, lead me home in childlike faith, home to my God.<br/>
To rest forever after earthly strife<br/>
In the calm light of everlasting life.<br/>
