<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord most dear,<br/>
as thou wast once an infant here,<br/>
so give this child of thine, we pray,<br/>
thy grace and blessing day by day.<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
O holy Jesus, Lord Divine,<br/>
we pray thee guard this child of thine.<br/>
<br/>
As in thy heavenly kingdom, Lord,<br/>
all things obey thy sacred word,<br/>
do thou thy mighty succor give,<br/>
and shield this child by morn and eve. Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Their watch let angels round him keep<br/>
where'er he be, awake, asleep;<br/>
thy holy cross now let him bear,<br/>
that he crown with saints may wear. Refrain . <br/>
