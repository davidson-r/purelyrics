title: Lo Now The Time Accepted Peals

Lo! Now the time accepted peals<br/>
Its tidings of release;<br/>
A time that with salvation heals,<br/>
And to repentant tears reveals<br/>
The mercy seat of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Then let us wisely now restrain<br/>
Our food, our drink, our sleep;<br/>
From idle word and jest refrain<br/>
And steadfastly begin again<br/>
A stricter watch to keep.<br/>
<br/>
Now Heav’n-taught love will haste to rise<br/>
And seek the cheerless bed,<br/>
Where cold and wan the sufferer lies,<br/>
And Christ Himself to heedful eyes<br/>
Is hungering for bread.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis now that zealous charity<br/>
Her goods more largely spends,<br/>
Lays up her treasure in the sky,<br/>
And freely yields, ere death draw nigh,<br/>
To God the wealth He lends.<br/>
<br/>
Then consecrate us, Lord, anew,<br/>
And fire our hearts with love;<br/>
That all we think, and all we do,<br/>
Within, without, be pure and true,<br/>
Rekindled from above.<br/>
<br/>
Now fuller praise and glory be<br/>
To Thee, the First and Last,<br/>
And make us, blessèd Trinity,<br/>
More faithful soldiers, worthier Thee,<br/>
Through this our chastening fast.
