title: Let all mortal flesh keep silence

<center>
<br/>
Let all mortal flesh keep silence,<br/>
And with fear and trembling stand;<br/>
Ponder nothing earthly minded,<br/>
For with blessing in His hand,<br/>
Christ our God to earth descendeth,<br/>
Our full homage to demand.<br/>
<br/>
King of kings, yet born of Mary,<br/>
As of old on earth He stood,<br/>
Lord of lords, in human vesture,<br/>
In the body and the blood;<br/>
He will give to all the faithful<br/>
His own self for heavenly food.<br/>
<br/>
Rank on rank the host of heaven<br/>
Spreads its vanguard on the way,<br/>
As the Light of light descendeth<br/>
From the realms of endless day,<br/>
That the powers of hell may vanish<br/>
As the darkness clears away.<br/>
<br/>
At His feet the six wing√®d seraph,<br/>
Cherubim with sleepless eye,<br/>
Veil their faces to the presence,<br/>
As with ceaseless voice they cry:<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia<br/>
Alleluia, Lord Most High!<br/>
