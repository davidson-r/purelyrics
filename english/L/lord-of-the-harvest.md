<br/>
Lord of the harvest, once again,<br/>
We thank Thee for the ripened grain;<br/>
For crops safe carried, sent to cheer<br/>
Thy servants through another year;<br/>
For all sweet holy thoughts supplied<br/>
By seed time, and by harvest tide.<br/>
<br/>
The bare dead grain, in autumn sown,<br/>
Its robe of vernal green it puts on;<br/>
Glad from its wintry grave it springs,<br/>
Fresh garnished by the King of kings;<br/>
So, Lord, to those who sleep in Thee<br/>
Shall new and glorious bodies be.<br/>
<br/>
Nor vainly of Thy Word we ask<br/>
A lesson from the reaper’s task:<br/>
So shall Thine angels issue forth:<br/>
The tares be burnt; the just of earth,<br/>
To wind and storm exposed no more,<br/>
Be gathered to their Father’s store.<br/>
<br/>
Daily, O Lord, our prayers be said,<br/>
As Thou hast taught, for daily bread;<br/>
But not alone our bodies feed,<br/>
Supply our fainting spirits’ need:<br/>
O Bread of life, from day to day<br/>
Be Thou their Comfort, Food, and Stay.<br/>
