<br/>
Birds are rejoicing,<br/>
O’er hill and dell;<br/>
Hushed is thy voicing,<br/>
Sweeter that fell.<br/>
Friend of our happy days,<br/>
Brother of prayer and praise,<br/>
Thine own sweet music says,<br/>
Loved one, farewell!<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast ascended,<br/>
Where angels dwell;<br/>
Where, earth songs ended,<br/>
Heav’n’s anthems swell.<br/>
Safe, all the saints among,<br/>
Blest with the praising throng,<br/>
Singing the new made songs,<br/>
Loved one, farewell!<br/>
<br/>
Salvation’s story<br/>
Then thou wilt tell;<br/>
Triumphs of glory,<br/>
Thy voice shall swell.<br/>
Rest thou, oh, friend so dear,<br/>
Thy precious Savior near,<br/>
Where God shall wipe each tear,<br/>
Loved one, farewell!<br/>
<br/>
Safe from thee turning,<br/>
Grief’s tones will knell;<br/>
Hard, hard the learning,<br/>
God doeth well!<br/>
Till, be it soon or late,<br/>
Up, at the pearly gate,<br/>
We meet, oh watch and wait,<br/>
Loved one, farewell!<br/>
