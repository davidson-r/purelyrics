<center>
Lord, in this Thy mercy’s day,<br/>
Ere for us it pass away,<br/>
On our knees we fall and pray.<br/>
<br/>
Holy Jesus, grant us tears,<br/>
Fill us with heart searching fears,<br/>
Ere the hour of doom appears.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, on us Thy Spirit pour,<br/>
Kneeling lowly at Thy door,<br/>
Ere it close forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
By Thy night of agony,<br/>
By Thy supplicating cry,<br/>
By Thy willingness to die,<br/>
<br/>
By Thy tears of bitter woe,<br/>
For Jerusalem below,<br/>
Let us not Thy peace forego.<br/>
<br/>
Judge and Savior of our race,<br/>
Grant us, when we see Thy face,<br/>
With Thy ransomed ones a place.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us ’neath Thy wings a place,<br/>
Lest we lose this day of grace,<br/>
Ere we shall behold Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
On Thy love we rest alone,<br/>
And that love shall then be known,<br/>
By the pardoned, round Thy throne.
</center>
