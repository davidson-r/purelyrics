Let the earth now praise the Lord.<br/>
Who hath truly kept His Word<br/>
And the sinners’ Help and Friend<br/>
Now at last to us doth send.<br/>
<br/>
What the fathers most desired,<br/>
What the prophet’s heart inspired,<br/>
What they longed for many a year,<br/>
Stands fulfilled in glory here.<br/>
<br/>
Abram’s promised great Reward,<br/>
Zion’s Helper, Jacob’s Lord,<br/>
Him of twofold race behold,<br/>
Truly came, as long foretold.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, O my Savior, now!<br/>
Hail! My Portion, Lord, art Thou.<br/>
Here, too, in my heart, I pray,<br/>
Oh, prepare Thyself a way!<br/>
<br/>
King of Glory, enter in;<br/>
Cleanse it from the filth of sin,<br/>
As Thou hast so often done;<br/>
It belongs to Thee alone.<br/>
<br/>
As Thy coming was in peace,<br/>
Quiet, full of gentleness,<br/>
Let the same mind dwell in me<br/>
That was ever found in Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Comfort my desponding heart:<br/>
Thou my Strength and Refuge art.<br/>
I am weak, and cunningly<br/>
Satan lays his snares for me.<br/>
<br/>
Bruise for me the Serpent’s head,<br/>
That, set free from doubt and dread,<br/>
I may cleave to Thee in faith,<br/>
Safely kept through life and death.<br/>
<br/>
And when Thou dost come again<br/>
As a glorious King to reign,<br/>
I with joy may see Thy face,<br/>
Freely ransomed by Thy grace.
