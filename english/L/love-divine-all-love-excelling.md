<br/>
Love Divine, all loves excelling,<br/>
Joy of heaven, to earth come down,<br/>
Fix in us thy humble dwelling,<br/>
All thy faithful mercies crown.<br/>
Jesus, thou art all compassion,<br/>
Pure unbounded love thou art;<br/>
Visit us with thy salvation,<br/>
Enter every trembling heart.<br/>
<br/>
Come, almighty to deliver,<br/>
Let us all thy grace receive;<br/>
Suddenly return, and never,<br/>
Never more thy temples leave.<br/>
Thee we would be always blessing,<br/>
Serve thee as thy hosts above,<br/>
Pray, and praise thee, without ceasing,<br/>
Glory in thy perfect love.<br/>
<br/>
Finish then thy new creation<br/>
Pure and spotless let us be;<br/>
Let us see thy great salvation,<br/>
Perfectly restored in thee,<br/>
Changed from glory into glory,<br/>
Till in heaven we take our place,<br/>
Till we cast our crowns before thee,<br/>
Lost in wonder, love, and praise!<br/>
