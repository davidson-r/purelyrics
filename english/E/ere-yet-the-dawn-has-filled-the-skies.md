<br/>
Ere yet the dawn has filled the skies,<br/>
Behold, my Savior Christ arise;<br/>
He chaseth from us sin and night,<br/>
And brings us joy and life and light.<br/>
<br/>
O stronger Thou than death and hell!<br/>
Where is the foe Thou canst not quell,<br/>
What heavy stone Thou canst not roll<br/>
From off the prisoned, anguished soul?<br/>
<br/>
If Jesus lives, can I be sad?<br/>
I know He loves me, and am glad;<br/>
Though all the world were dead to me,<br/>
Enough, O Christ, if I have Thee!<br/>
<br/>
He feeds me, comforts and defends,<br/>
And when I die His angel sends<br/>
To bear me whither He is gone,<br/>
For of His own He loseth none.<br/>
<br/>
Strong Champion! For this comfort, see,<br/>
The whole world brings her thanks to Thee;<br/>
And once we, too, shall raise above<br/>
More sweet and loud the song of love.<br/>
