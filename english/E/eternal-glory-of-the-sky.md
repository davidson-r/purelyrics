<br/>
Eternal Glory of the sky,<br/>
Blest Hope of frail humanity,<br/>
The Father’s sole begotten One,<br/>
Yet born a spotless virgin’s Son!<br/>
<br/>
Uplift us with Thine arm of might,<br/>
And let our hearts rise pure and bright,<br/>
And, ardent in God’s praises, pay<br/>
The thanks we owe him every day.<br/>
<br/>
The day-star’s rays are glittering clear,<br/>
And tell that day itself is near:<br/>
The shadows of the night depart;<br/>
Thou, holy Light, illume the heart!<br/>
<br/>
Within our senses ever dwell,<br/>
And worldly darkness thence expel;<br/>
Long as the days of life endure,<br/>
Preserve our souls devout and pure.<br/>
<br/>
The faith that first must be possessed,<br/>
Root deep within our inmost breast;<br/>
And joyous hope in second place,<br/>
Then charity, Thy greatest grace.<br/>
<br/>
All laud to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To God the Holy Paraclete.<br/>
