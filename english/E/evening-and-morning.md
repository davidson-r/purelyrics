<br/>
Evening and morning, sunset and dawning,<br/>
Wealth, peace and gladness, comfort in sadness,<br/>
These are Thy works; all the glory be Thine!<br/>
Times without number, awake or in slumber,<br/>
Thine eye observes us, from danger preserves us,<br/>
Causing Thy mercy upon us to shine.<br/>
<br/>
Father, O hear me, pardon and spare me;<br/>
Calm all my terrors, blot out my errors,<br/>
That by Thine eyes they may no more be scanned.<br/>
Order my goings, direct all my doings;<br/>
As it may please Thee retain or release me;<br/>
All I commit to Thy fatherly hand.<br/>
