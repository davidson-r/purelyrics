<center>
With a strong and glad endeavor<br/>
Let us rally round the cross,<br/>
One in heart and zeal forever<br/>
Seek to save the world from loss.<br/>
In no scant and stinted measure<br/>
Be our wealth and service giv’n;<br/>
Let no love of ease or pleasure<br/>
Hedge to one the way to Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
In the joy of love’s communion,<br/>
Finding motive and reward;<br/>
Strong in purpose, strong in union,<br/>
As an army of the Lord,<br/>
Let us on to fight our battles<br/>
In the heav’nly Master’s Name,<br/>
Though the thunder rolls and rattles,<br/>
Though the sheeted lightnings flame.
