<br/>
“Echoes of glory” are ringing<br/>
Down thro’ the gates so fair;<br/>
News of sweet rest they are bringing,<br/>
To hearts that are weary with care.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh! “Echoes of glory”<br/>
From angels so fair,<br/>
List to the music,<br/>
That floats on the air.<br/>
<br/>
“Echoes of glory” are sweetly<br/>
Coming to cheer the weak,<br/>
Filling the soul thus completely,<br/>
With love that the sorrowing seek.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Echoes of glory” come ever<br/>
Telling of rest at last,<br/>
When we shall cross o’er the river,<br/>
And life with its turmoil is past.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
