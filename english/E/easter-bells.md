<br/>
O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,<br/>
Let the whole world join the happy lay,<br/>
Let the hills and vales break forth in singing,<br/>
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris’n today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
Let the whole world join the happy lay,<br/>
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br/>
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris’n today.<br/>
<br/>
O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,<br/>
Hear the shouts along the King’s highway;<br/>
Songs of praise the children, too, are singing,<br/>
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris’n today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O the Easter bells are gladly ringing,<br/>
For the night of death has passed away,<br/>
Lo! the gates of morn are open swinging,<br/>
Christ, the Lord of Life, is ris’n today.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
