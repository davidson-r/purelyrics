title: Early My God Without Delay

<center>
<br/>
Early, my God, without delay,<br/>
I haste to seek Thy face;<br/>
My thirsty spirit faints away<br/>
Without Thy cheering grace.<br/>
<br/>
So pilgrims on the scorching sand,<br/>
Beneath a burning sky,<br/>
Long for a cooling stream at hand,<br/>
And they must drink or die.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve seen Thy glory and Thy power<br/>
Through all Thy temple shine;<br/>
My God, repeat that heav’nly hour,<br/>
That vision so divine.<br/>
<br/>
Not all the blessings of a feast<br/>
Can please my soul so well,<br/>
As when Thy richer grace I taste,<br/>
And in Thy presence dwell.<br/>
<br/>
Not life itself, with all her joys,<br/>
Can my best passions move,<br/>
Or raise so high my cheerful voice,<br/>
As Thy forgiving love.<br/>
<br/>
Thus till my last expiring day<br/>
I’ll bless my God and King;<br/>
Thus will I lift my hands to pray,<br/>
And tune my lips to sing.<br/>
