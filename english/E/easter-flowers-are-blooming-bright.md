Easter flowers are blooming bright,<br/>
Easter skies pour radiant light,<br/>
Christ our Lord is risen in might,<br/>
Glory in the highest!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Christ our Lord is risen in might,<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Angels caroled this sweet lay,<br/>
When in manger rude He lay,<br/>
Now once more cast grief away,<br/>
Glory in the highest!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
He, then born to grief and pain,<br/>
Now to glory born again,<br/>
Calleth forth our gladdest strain,<br/>
Glory in the highest!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
As He riseth, rise we too,<br/>
Tune we heart and voice anew,<br/>
Offering homage glad and true,<br/>
Glory in the highest!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
