title: Every Morning the Red Sun

<center>
Every morning the red sun<br/>
Rises warm and bright;<br/>
But the evening cometh on,<br/>
And the dark, cold night.<br/>
There’s a bright land far away,<br/>
Where ’tis never-ending day.<br/>
<br/>
Every spring the sweet young flowers<br/>
Open bright and gay,<br/>
Till the chilly autumn hours<br/>
Wither them away.<br/>
There’s a land we have not seen,<br/>
Where the trees are always green.<br/>
<br/>
Little birds sing songs of praise<br/>
All the summer long,<br/>
But in colder, shorter days<br/>
They forget their song.<br/>
There’s a place where angels sing<br/>
Ceaseless praises to their King.<br/>
<br/>
Christ our Lord is ever near<br/>
Those who follow Him;<br/>
But we cannot see Him here,<br/>
For our eyes are dim;<br/>
There is a most happy place,<br/>
Where men always see His face.<br/>
<br/>
Who shall go to that bright land?<br/>
All who do the right:<br/>
Holy children there shall stand<br/>
In their robes of white;<br/>
For that Heav’n, so bright and blest,<br/>
Is our everlasting rest.
