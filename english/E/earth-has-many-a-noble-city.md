<br/>
Earth has many a noble city;<br/>
Bethlehem, thou dost all excel;<br/>
Out of thee the Lord from Heaven<br/>
Came to rule His Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Fairer than the sun at morning<br/>
Was the star that told His birth,<br/>
To the world its God announcing<br/>
Seen in fleshly form on earth.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern sages at His cradle<br/>
Make oblations rich and rare;<br/>
See them give, in deep devotion,<br/>
Gold and frankincense and myrrh.<br/>
<br/>
Sacred gifts of mystic meaning:<br/>
Incense doth their God disclose,<br/>
Gold the King of kings proclaimeth,<br/>
Myrrh His sepulcher foreshows.<br/>
<br/>
Jesu, whom the Gentiles worshipped<br/>
At Thy glad Epiphany,<br/>
Unto Thee, with God the Father<br/>
And the Spirit, glory be.<br/>
