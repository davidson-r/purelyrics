Earth today rejoices,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Death can hurt no more;<br/>
And celestial voices,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Tell that sin is o'er.<br/>
David's sling destroys the foe:<br/>
Samson lays the temple low:<br/>
War and strife are done,<br/>
God and man are one.<br/>
<br/>
Reconciliation,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Peace that lasts for aye.<br/>
Gladness and salvation,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Came on Christmas Day.<br/>
Gideon's Fleece is wet with dew,<br/>
Solomon is crown'd anew:<br/>
War and strife are done.<br/>
God and man are one.<br/>
<br/>
Though the cold grows stronger,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Though the world loves night,<br/>
Yet the days grow longer,<br/>
Alleluya, Alleluya, Alleluya,<br/>
Chris is born our Light.<br/>
Now the Dial's type is learnt,<br/>
Burns the Bush that is not burnt:<br/>
War and strife are done;<br/>
God and man are one.
