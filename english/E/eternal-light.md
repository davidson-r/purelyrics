<br/>
Eternal Light! eternal Light!<br/>
How pure the soul must be<br/>
When, placed within Thy searching sight,<br/>
It shrinks not, but with calm delight<br/>
Can live, and look on Thee!<br/>
<br/>
The spirits that surround Thy throne<br/>
May bear the burning bliss;<br/>
But that is surely theirs alone,<br/>
Since they have never, never known<br/>
A fallen world like this.<br/>
<br/>
O how shall I, whose native sphere<br/>
Is dark, whose mind is dim,<br/>
Before the Ineffable appear,<br/>
And on my naked spirit bear<br/>
That uncreated beam?<br/>
<br/>
There is a way for man to rise<br/>
To that sublime abode:<br/>
An offering and a sacrifice,<br/>
A Holy Spiritâ€™s energies,<br/>
An Advocate with God.<br/>
<br/>
These, these prepare us for the sight<br/>
Of holiness above;<br/>
The sons of ignorance and night,<br/>
May dwell in the eternal Light,<br/>
Through the eternal Love.<br/>
