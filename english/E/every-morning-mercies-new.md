title: Every Morning Mercies New

<center>
Every morning mercies new<br/>
Fall as fresh as morning dew;<br/>
Every morning let us pay<br/>
Tribute with the early day:<br/>
For Thy mercies, Lord, are sure;<br/>
Thy compassion doth endure.<br/>
<br/>
Still the greatness of Thy love<br/>
Daily doth our sins remove;<br/>
Daily, far as east from west,<br/>
Lifts the burden from the breast;<br/>
Gives unbought to those who pray<br/>
Strength to stand in evil day.<br/>
<br/>
Let our prayers each morn prevail,<br/>
That these gifts may never fail;<br/>
And, as we confess the sin<br/>
And the tempter’s power within,<br/>
Every morning, for the strife,<br/>
Feed us with the Bread of Life.<br/>
<br/>
As the morning light returns,<br/>
As the sun with splendor burns,<br/>
Teach us still to turn to Thee,<br/>
Ever blessèd Trinity,<br/>
With our hands our hearts to raise,<br/>
In unfailing prayer and praise.
