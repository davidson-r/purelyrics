title: Eye hath not seen

<br/>
They tell me of a land so fair,<br/>
Unseen by mortal eyes,<br/>
Where spring in fadeless beauty blooms,<br/>
Beneath unclouded skies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,<br/>
Neither hath it entered into the heart of man,<br/>
The things which God hath prepared for them,<br/>
Prepared for them that love Him.”<br/>
<br/>
They tell me of a land so fair,<br/>
Where all is light and song,<br/>
Where angel choirs their anthems join<br/>
With yonder blood-washed throng.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No radiant beams from sun or moon<br/>
Adorn that land so fair,<br/>
For He who sits upon the throne<br/>
Shines forth resplendent there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O land of light and love and joy,<br/>
Where comes no night of care,<br/>
What will our song of triumph be<br/>
When we shall enter there!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
