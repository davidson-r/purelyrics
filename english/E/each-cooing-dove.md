<br/>
Each cooing dove and sighing bough,<br/>
That makes the eve so blest to me,<br/>
Has something far diviner now,<br/>
It bears me back to Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O Galilee, sweet Galilee,<br/>
Where Jesus loved so much to be,<br/>
O Galilee, blue Galilee,<br/>
Come sing thy song again to me.<br/>
<br/>
Each flowery glen and mossy dell,<br/>
Where happy birds in song agree,<br/>
Through sunny morn the praises tell<br/>
Of sights and sounds in Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And when I read the thrilling lore<br/>
Of Him Who walked upon the sea,<br/>
I long, oh, how I long once more<br/>
To follow Him in Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
