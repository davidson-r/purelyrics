<center>
Deep and grand in tones sublime,<br/>
Hear the passing bells of time,<br/>
Ring the dirge of moments dead,<br/>
Golden hours whose joys are fled—<br/>
Still those bells of time we hear,<br/>
Tolling, tolling: Hark! the word:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Eternity!<br/>
Eternity!<br/>
Eternity!<br/>
<br/>
In the rosy morning fair,<br/>
In the sultry noonday glare,<br/>
In the dewy evening bright,<br/>
In the silent hush of night—<br/>
Still those bells of time we hear,<br/>
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When with breaking heart we bend,<br/>
O’er a tried and faithful friend,<br/>
When the parting hour draws nigh,<br/>
And we catch the last “goodbye”—<br/>
Still those bells of time we hear,<br/>
Tolling, tolling, loud and clear:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Precious word! if safe we stand<br/>
On the Christian’s borderland<br/>
Trusting Him, Whose loving smile<br/>
Lights and cheers us all the while—<br/>
Bells of time with joy we hear,<br/>
Tolling, tolling, sweet and clear:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
