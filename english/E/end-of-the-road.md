<br/>
When I come to the end of the long, long road,<br/>
The shadows will flee away,<br/>
And I’ll stand in the glorious light of God,<br/>
Where dwelleth eternal day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When I come to the end, the end of the road,<br/>
To the land of eternity,<br/>
When I come to the end of life’s long road,<br/>
The face of my Lord I’ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back o’er the years that were hard and drear,<br/>
The hand of the Christ I’ll see;<br/>
While my heart will go forth with a song of praise,<br/>
Because of His love for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When I come to the end of the long, long road,<br/>
And trials will all be past,<br/>
I shall look in the face of my dearest Friend,<br/>
Safe home in His Heav’n at last.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
