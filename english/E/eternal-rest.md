<br/>
Time’s clock is striking the hour,<br/>
Jesus will soon descend,<br/>
Clothed in the garments of power,<br/>
The reign of sin to end.<br/>
Then will this anthem be ringing<br/>
Like to a mighty flood,<br/>
Then ’round the throne we’ll be singing,<br/>
Glory and praise to God.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory, glory to God!<br/>
Thus will the ransomed sing;<br/>
Glory, glory to God,<br/>
The everlasting King!<br/>
Praise Him, alleluia!<br/>
To that eternal sphere<br/>
We are waiting<br/>
For our translating;<br/>
The time is near.<br/>
<br/>
In those bright mansions supernal,<br/>
Death cannot enter there;<br/>
Ages on ages eternal<br/>
His likeness we shall bear.<br/>
There will the once brokenhearted<br/>
Rest in the spirit know;<br/>
Sorrow forever departed,<br/>
Gladness shall overflow.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sighing forever is ended,<br/>
Foes shall oppress no more;<br/>
Voices in worship are blended<br/>
To Him Whom all adore.<br/>
Bathed in the light soft and tender,<br/>
Sealed for eternity,<br/>
Praise to the Lamb we will render—<br/>
Worthy of praise is He.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, wonderful story!<br/>
Jesus Himself the Light;<br/>
There in the kingdom of glory<br/>
Never shall fall the night.<br/>
Now I am singing of heaven,<br/>
While here I wage the strife;<br/>
Then will the victors be given<br/>
Crowns of eternal life.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
