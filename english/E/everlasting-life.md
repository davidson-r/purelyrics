“Everlasting life!” is the promise giv’n unto them<br/>
Who love the Savior dear.<br/>
“Everlasting life!” and a home in Heav’n,<br/>
If you will believe His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then believe Him! O receive Him!<br/>
Blessèd Savior, kingly favor.<br/>
Give Him ever best endeavor,<br/>
For with Him is everlasting life!<br/>
<br/>
“Everlasting life!” shout it far and wide,<br/>
Blessèd tidings of salvation free.<br/>
“Everlasting life!” thro’ His blood applied,<br/>
To the sinner in his woe.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Everlasting life!” there is naught to do but to take<br/>
The words He gives you now.<br/>
“Everlasting life!” precious gift for you,<br/>
Thro’ the Savior crucified.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
