<br/>
Eternal Father, strong to save,<br/>
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave, <br/>
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep<br/>
Its own appointed limits keep;<br/>
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,<br/>
For those in peril on the sea! <br/>
<br/>
O Christ! Whose voice the waters heard<br/>
And hushed their raging at Thy word,<br/>
Who walked'st on the foaming deep,<br/>
And calm amidst its rage didst sleep;<br/>
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,<br/>
For those in peril on the sea!<br/>
<br/>
Most Holy Spirit! Who didst brood<br/>
Upon the chaos dark and rude,<br/>
And bid its angry tumult cease,<br/>
And give, for wild confusion, peace;<br/>
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,<br/>
For those in peril on the sea! <br/>
<br/>
O Trinity of love and power!<br/>
Our brethren shield in danger's hour; <br/>
From rock and tempest, fire and foe, <br/>
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;<br/>
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee<br/>
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.<br/>
