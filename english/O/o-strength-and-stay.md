O Strength and Stay upholding all creation,<br/>
Who ever dost Thyself unmoved abide;<br/>
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br/>
From hour to hour through all its changes guide.<br/>
<br/>
Grant to lifeâ€™s day a calm unclouded ending,<br/>
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br/>
The brightness of a holy deathbed blending<br/>
With dawning glories of the eternal day.<br/>
<br/>
Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br/>
Through Jesus Christ Thy co-eternal Word,<br/>
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br/>
Now and to endless ages art adored.
