<br/>
O Christ, Who hast prepared a place<br/>
For us around Thy throne of grace,<br/>
We pray Thee, lift our hearts above,<br/>
And draw them with the cords of love.<br/>
<br/>
Source of all good, Thou, gracious Lord,<br/>
Art our exceeding great reward;<br/>
How transient is our present pain,<br/>
How boundless our eternal gain!<br/>
<br/>
With open face and joyful heart,<br/>
We then shall see Thee as Thou art:<br/>
Our love shall never cease to glow,<br/>
Our praise shall never cease to flow.<br/>
<br/>
Thy never-failing grace to prove,<br/>
A surety of Thine endless love,<br/>
Send down Thy Holy Ghost, to be<br/>
The raiser of our souls to Thee.<br/>
