<br/>
Our Lord and God, oh, bless this day<br/>
And hear us, we implore Thee;<br/>
None of Thy children turn away<br/>
Who now appear before Thee.<br/>
We come before Thy face<br/>
And pray: Let Thy rich grace<br/>
Descend from Heav’n above<br/>
In all Thy wondrous love<br/>
And keep us by Thy Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, bless Thy Word to all the young;<br/>
Let them, Thy truth possessing,<br/>
Bear witness true with heart and tongue,<br/>
Their faith and ours confessing.<br/>
From mother’s arms Thy grace<br/>
With love did them embrace;<br/>
Baptized into Thy Name,<br/>
As Thine Thou didst them claim.<br/>
O Lord, as Thine now own them!<br/>
<br/>
When they their vows today renew,<br/>
Accept them with Thy favor;<br/>
And when they promise to be true,<br/>
May they forget it never!<br/>
But they are weak and frail<br/>
When Satan’s hosts assail;<br/>
Oh, arm them with Thy might<br/>
And grant that in the fight<br/>
They unto death be faithful!<br/>
<br/>
And when they leave their childhood home,<br/>
When Satan comes alluring,<br/>
May their baptismal grace become<br/>
A refuge reassuring!<br/>
Blest he who then can say:<br/>
“God’s covenant stands for aye.”<br/>
He ne’er shall be undone<br/>
Who trusts in God alone<br/>
God is his mighty Father!<br/>
