O little town of Bethlehem<br/>
How still we see thee lie<br/>
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br/>
The silent stars go by<br/>
Yet in thy dark streets shineth<br/>
The everlasting Light<br/>
The hopes and fears of all the years<br/>
Are met in thee tonight<br/>
<br/>
For Christ is born of Mary<br/>
And gathered all above<br/>
While mortals sleep, the angels keep<br/>
Their watch of wondering love<br/>
O morning stars together<br/>
Proclaim the holy birth<br/>
And praises sing to God the King<br/>
And Peace to men on earth<br/>
<br/>
How silently, how silently<br/>
The wondrous gift is given!<br/>
So God imparts to human hearts<br/>
The blessings of His heaven.<br/>
No ear may his His coming,<br/>
But in this world of sin,<br/>
Where meek souls will receive him still,<br/>
The dear Christ enters in.<br/>
<br/>
O holy Child of Bethlehem<br/>
Descend to us, we pray<br/>
Cast out our sin and enter in<br/>
Be born to us today<br/>
We hear the Christmas angels<br/>
The great glad tidings tell<br/>
O come to us, abide with us<br/>
Our Lord Emmanuel.
