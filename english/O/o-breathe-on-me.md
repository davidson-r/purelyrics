title: O Breathe on Me

<br/>
O breathe on me, O breath of God,<br/>
fill me with life anew that I may love<br/>
the things You love, and do what you would do.<br/>
<br/>
O breathe on me, O breath of God,<br/>
until my heart is pure;<br/>
until my will is one with Yours,<br/>
to do and to endure.<br/>
<br/>
O breathe on me, O breath of God,<br/>
my will to Yours incline,<br/>
until this selfish part of me<br/>
glows with Your fire divine.<br/>
<br/>
O breathe on me, O breath of God,<br/>
so I shall never die,<br/>
but live with You the perfect life<br/>
for all eternity. <br/>
