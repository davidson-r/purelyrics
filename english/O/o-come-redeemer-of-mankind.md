title: O come Redeemer of mankind

<center>
O come, Redeemer of mankind, appear,<br/>
Thee with full hearts the virgin born we greet;<br/>
Let every age with rapt amazement hear<br/>
That wondrous birth which for our God is meet.<br/>
<br/>
Not by the will of man, or mortal seed,<br/>
But by the Spirit’s breathed mysterious grace<br/>
The Word of God became our flesh indeed,<br/>
And grew a tender plant of human race.<br/>
<br/>
Lo! Mary’s virgin womb its burden bears;<br/>
Nor less abides her virgin purity;<br/>
In the King’s glory see our nature shares;<br/>
Here in His temple God vouchsafes to be.<br/>
<br/>
From His bright chamber, virtue’s holy shrine<br/>
The royal Bridegroom cometh to the day;<br/>
Of twofold substance, human and divine,<br/>
As giant swift, rejoicing on His way.<br/>
<br/>
Forth from His Father to the world He goes,<br/>
Back to the Father’s face His way regains,<br/>
Far down to souls beneath His glory shows,<br/>
Again at God’s right hand victorious reigns.<br/>
<br/>
With the eternal Father equal, Thou,<br/>
Girt with our flesh dost triumph evermore,<br/>
Strengthening our feeble bodies here below<br/>
With endless grace from Thine own living store.<br/>
<br/>
How doth Thy lowly manger radiant shine!<br/>
On the sweet breath of night new splendor grows;<br/>
So may our spirits glow with faith divine,<br/>
Where no dark cloud of sin shall interpose.<br/>
<br/>
All praise and glory to the Father be,<br/>
All praise and glory to His only Son,<br/>
All praise and glory, Holy Ghost, to Thee,<br/>
Both now, and while eternal ages run.
