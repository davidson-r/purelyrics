O Mother blest, whom God bestows<br/>
On sinners and on just,<br/>
What joy, what hope thou givest those<br/>
Who in thy mercy trust.<br/>
<br/>
(Refrain)<br/>
<br/>
Most holy Mary, at thy feet<br/>
Thy children bend a suppliant knee;<br/>
Dear Mother of my God,<br/>
Do thou remember me. <br/>
Remember, Mary, Virgin fair,<br/>
It never yet was told<br/>
That he who humbly sought thy care<br/>
Departed unconsoled.<br/>
<br/>
(Refrain)<br/>
<br/>
Most holy Mary, at thy feet<br/>
Thy children bend a suppliant knee;<br/>
Dear Mother of my God,<br/>
Do thou remember me. <br/>
O Mother blest, for me obtain,<br/>
Ungrateful though I be,<br/>
To love that God Who first could deign<br/>
To show such love to me.<br/>
<br/>
(Refrain)<br/>
<br/>
Most holy Mary, at thy feet<br/>
Thy children bend a suppliant knee;<br/>
Dear Mother of my God,<br/>
Do thou remember me. . <br/>
