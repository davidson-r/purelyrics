O bless√®d home where man and wife<br/>
Together lead a godly life<br/>
By deeds their faith confessing!<br/>
There many a happy day is spent,<br/>
There Jesus gladly will consent<br/>
To tarry with His blessing.<br/>
<br/>
If they have given Him their heart,<br/>
The place of honor set apart<br/>
For Him each night and morrow,<br/>
Then He the storms of life will calm,<br/>
Will bring for every wound a balm,<br/>
And change to joy their sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
And if their home be dark and drear,<br/>
The cruse be empty, hunger near,<br/>
All hope within them dying,<br/>
Let them despair not in distress;<br/>
Lo, Christ is there the bread to bless,<br/>
The fragments multiplying.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, we come before Thy face;<br/>
In every home bestow Thy grace<br/>
On children, father, mother,<br/>
Relieve their wants, their burdens ease,<br/>
Let them together dwell in peace<br/>
And love to one another.
