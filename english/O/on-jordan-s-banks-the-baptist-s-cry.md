<br/>
On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry<br/>
Announces that the Lord is nigh;<br/>
Come, then, and hearken, for he brings<br/>
Glad tidings from the King of kings!<br/>
<br/>
Then cleansed be every breast from sin;<br/>
Make straight the way for God within;<br/>
Prepare we in our hearts a home,<br/>
Where such a mighty Guest may come.<br/>
<br/>
For Thou art our Salvation, Lord,<br/>
Our Refuge, and our great Reward.<br/>
Without Thy grace our souls must fade<br/>
And wither like a flower decayed.<br/>
<br/>
Stretch forth Thine hand, to heal our sore,<br/>
And make us rise and fall no more;<br/>
Once more upon Thy people shine,<br/>
And fill the world with love divine.<br/>
<br/>
To Him Who left the throne of Heaven<br/>
To save mankind, all praise be given;<br/>
Like praise be to the Father done,<br/>
And Holy Spirit, Three in One.<br/>
