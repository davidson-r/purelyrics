<br/>
O merciful Creator, hear;<br/>
In tender pity bow Thine ear:<br/>
Accept the tearful prayer we raise<br/>
In this our fast of forty days.<br/>
<br/>
Each heart is manifest to Thee;<br/>
Thou knowest our infirmity:<br/>
Repentant now we seek Thy face;<br/>
Impart to us Thy pardoning grace.<br/>
<br/>
Our sins are manifold and sore,<br/>
But spare Thou them who sin deplore;<br/>
And for Thine own Nameâ€™s sake make whole<br/>
The fainting and the weary soul.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us to mortify each sense<br/>
By means of outward abstinence,<br/>
That so from every stain of sin<br/>
The soul may keep her fast within.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Three in One, and One in Three<br/>
Almighty God, we pray to Thee,<br/>
That Thou wouldst now vouchsafe to bless<br/>
Our fast with fruits of righteousness.<br/>
