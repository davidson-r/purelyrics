<br/>
Once o’er Judea’s hills by night<br/>
Was heard a joyful sound,<br/>
A host appeared, of angels bright,<br/>
And glory shone around.<br/>
Fear not, they sing, to you we bring<br/>
Glad tidings, peace on earth;<br/>
Good will to men, they caroled then,<br/>
And sang the Savior’s birth.<br/>
On Bethl’em’s plain no more we hear<br/>
The wondrous heav’nly chime;<br/>
But we can sound a strain as dear,<br/>
This joyful Christmas morn.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Our song we raise as God we praise,<br/>
Good will and peace on earth;<br/>
With heart and voice we all rejoice,<br/>
And sing the Savior’s birth.<br/>
<br/>
When they had sung their song of love,<br/>
The angels went away,<br/>
To sing in joyful courts above<br/>
That first glad Christmas day.<br/>
The shepherds heard the wondrous word<br/>
The angels brought to them;<br/>
Then hastened they where sleeping lay<br/>
The Babe of Bethlehem.<br/>
Around the manger gathering,<br/>
O! let us prostrate fall;<br/>
And to the infant Savior bring<br/>
Our hearts, our lives our all!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
