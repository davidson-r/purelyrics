title: O Perfect Love

<br/>
O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,<br/>
Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,<br/>
That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,<br/>
Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.<br/>
<br/>
O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance,<br/>
Of tender charity and steadfast faith,<br/>
Of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,<br/>
With childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.<br/>
<br/>
Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;<br/>
Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,<br/>
And to lifeâ€™s day the glorious unknown morrow<br/>
That dawns upon eternal love and life.<br/>
<br/>
Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br/>
Through Jesus Christ, Thy coeternal Word,<br/>
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br/>
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br/>
