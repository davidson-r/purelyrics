<br/>
O God, great Father, Lord and King!<br/>
Our children unto Thee we bring;<br/>
And strong in faith, and hope, and love,<br/>
We dare Thy steadfast Word to prove.<br/>
<br/>
Thy covenant kindness did of old<br/>
Our fathers and their seed enfold;<br/>
That ancient promise standeth sure,<br/>
And shall while heaven and earth endure.<br/>
<br/>
Look down upon us while we pray,<br/>
And visit us in grace today;<br/>
These little ones in mercy take<br/>
And make them Thine for Jesusâ€™ sake.<br/>
<br/>
While they the outward sign receive,<br/>
Wilt Thou Thy Holy Spirit give,<br/>
And keep and help them by Thy power<br/>
In every hard and trying hour.<br/>
<br/>
Guide Thou their feet in holy ways:<br/>
Shine on them through the darkest days;<br/>
Uphold them till their life be past,<br/>
And bring them all to heaven at last.<br/>
