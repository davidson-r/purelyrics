title: O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go

<center>
O Love that wilt not let me go,<br/>
I rest my weary soul in thee;<br/>
I give thee back the life I owe,<br/>
That in thine ocean depths its flow<br/>
May richer, fuller be.<br/>
<br/>
O light that followest all my way,<br/>
I yield my flickering torch to thee;<br/>
My heart restores its borrowed ray,<br/>
That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day<br/>
May brighter, fairer be.<br/>
<br/>
O Joy that seekest me through pain,<br/>
I cannot close my heart to thee;<br/>
I trace the rainbow through the rain,<br/>
And feel the promise is not vain,<br/>
That morn shall tearless be.<br/>
<br/>
O Cross that liftest up my head,<br/>
I dare not ask to fly from thee;<br/>
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,<br/>
And from the ground there blossoms red<br/>
Life that shall endless be.
