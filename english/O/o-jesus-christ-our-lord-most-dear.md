<br/>
O Jesus Christ, our Lord most dear,<br/>
As Thou wast once an Infant here<br/>
So give this child of Thine, we pray,<br/>
Thy grace and blessing day by day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O holy Jesus, Lord divine,<br/>
We pray Thee guard this child of Thine.<br/>
<br/>
As in Thy heavâ€™nly kingdom, Lord,<br/>
Thy messengers obey Thy word,<br/>
Send forth the succor of Thy might<br/>
To shield this child both day and night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
And all his life, let angels keep<br/>
Him safe from harm, awake, asleep;<br/>
May he not bear the cross in vain,<br/>
But with Thy saints a crown attain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
