<br/>
The old year now hath passed away;<br/>
We thank Thee, O our God, today<br/>
That Thou hast kept us through the year<br/>
When danger and distress were near.<br/>
<br/>
We pray Thee, O eternal Son,<br/>
Who with the Father reign’st as One,<br/>
To guard and rule Thy Christendom<br/>
Through all the ages yet to come.<br/>
<br/>
Take not Thy saving Word away,<br/>
Our souls’ true comfort, staff, and stay.<br/>
Abide with us and keep us free<br/>
From errors, following only Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, help us to forsake all sin,<br/>
A new and holier course begin!<br/>
Mark not what once was done amiss;<br/>
A happier, better year be this,<br/>
<br/>
Wherein as Christians we may live<br/>
Or die in peace that Thou canst give,<br/>
To rise again when Thou shalt come<br/>
And enter Thine eternal home.<br/>
<br/>
There shall we thank Thee and adore<br/>
With all the angels evermore.<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, increase our faith<br/>
To praise Thy Name through life and death.<br/>
