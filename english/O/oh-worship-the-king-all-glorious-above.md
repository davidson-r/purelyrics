<center>
Oh, worship the King, all glorious above.<br/>
Oh, gratefully sing his power and his love;<br/>
Our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days,<br/>
Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, tell of his might; oh, sing of his grace,<br/>
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;<br/>
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form,<br/>
And dark is his path on the wings of the storm.<br/>
<br/>
The earth with its store of wonders untold,<br/>
Almighty, your power has founded of old,<br/>
Established it fast by a changeless decree,<br/>
And round it has cast, like a mantle, the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Your bountiful care what tongue can recite?<br/>
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light,<br/>
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain<br/>
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.<br/>
<br/>
Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,<br/>
In you do we trust, nor find you to fail;<br/>
Your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end, <br/>
Our maker, defender, redeemer, and friend!<br/>
<br/>
O measureless Might, ineffable Love,<br/>
While angels delight to hymn you above.<br/>
The humbler creation, though feeble their lays,<br/>
With true adoration shall sing to your praise.
