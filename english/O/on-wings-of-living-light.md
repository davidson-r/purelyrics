<br/>
On wings of living light,<br/>
At earliest dawn of day,<br/>
Came down the angel bright;<br/>
And rolled the stone away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Your voices raise with one accord,<br/>
To bless and praise your risen Lord!<br/>
To bless and praise your risen Lord!<br/>
<br/>
The keepers watching near,<br/>
At that dread sight and sound;<br/>
Fell down with sudden fear<br/>
Like dead men to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then rose from death’s dark gloom,<br/>
Unseen by mortal eye,<br/>
Triumphant o’er the tomb,<br/>
The Lord of earth and sky!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let your hearts be strong!<br/>
For we, like Him, shall rise;<br/>
To dwell with Him ere long<br/>
In bliss beyond the skies!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
