<br/>
O voice of the Belovèd!<br/>
Thy bride hath heard Thee say,<br/>
“Rise up, My love, My fair one,<br/>
Arise and come away.<br/>
For lo, ’tis past, the winter,<br/>
The winter of thy year;<br/>
The rain is past and over,<br/>
The flowers on earth appear.<br/>
<br/>
“And now the time of singing<br/>
Is come for every bird;<br/>
And over all the country<br/>
The turtle dove is heard;<br/>
The fig her green fruit ripens,<br/>
The vines are in their bloom;<br/>
Arise and smell their fragrance;<br/>
My love, My fair one, come!”<br/>
<br/>
Yea, Lord! Thy Passion over,<br/>
We know this life of ours<br/>
Hath passed from death and winter<br/>
To leaves and budding flowers;<br/>
No more Thy rain of weeping<br/>
In drear Gethsemane;<br/>
No more the clouds and darkness,<br/>
That veiled Thy bitter Tree.<br/>
<br/>
Our Easter Sun is risen!<br/>
And yet we slumber long,<br/>
And need Thy Dove’s sweet pleading<br/>
To waken prayer and song.<br/>
Oh breathe upon our deadness,<br/>
Oh shine upon our gloom;<br/>
Lord, let us feel Thy presence<br/>
And rise and live and bloom.<br/>
