O Jesus, Lord of heavenly grace,<br/>
Thou Brightness of Thy Father’s face,<br/>
Thou Fountain of eternal light,<br/>
Whose beams disperse the shades of night.<br/>
<br/>
Come, holy Sun of heavenly love,<br/>
Shower down Thy radiance from above,<br/>
And to our inward hearts convey<br/>
The Holy Spirit’s cloudless ray.<br/>
<br/>
So we the Father’s help will claim,<br/>
And sing the Father’s glorious Name,<br/>
And His almighty grace implore<br/>
That we may stand, to fall no more.<br/>
<br/>
May He our actions deign to bless,<br/>
And loose the bonds of wickedness;<br/>
From sudden falls our feet defend,<br/>
And bring us to a prosperous end.<br/>
<br/>
May faith, deep rooted in the soul,<br/>
Subdue our flesh, our minds control;<br/>
May guile depart, and discord cease,<br/>
And all within be joy and peace.<br/>
<br/>
So let us gladly pass the day;<br/>
Our thoughts be pure as morning ray;<br/>
And faithful love our noonday light;<br/>
And hope our sunset, calm and bright.<br/>
<br/>
O Christ, with each returning morn<br/>
Thine image to our hearts is borne:<br/>
O may we ever clearly see<br/>
Our Savior and our God in Thee.
