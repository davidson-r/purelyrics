<br/>
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br/>
With the cross of Jesus going on before.<br/>
Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;<br/>
Forward into battle see His banners go!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br/>
With the cross of Jesus going on before.<br/>
<br/>
At the sign of triumph Satan’s host doth flee;<br/>
On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!<br/>
Hell’s foundations quiver at the shout of praise;<br/>
Brothers lift your voices, loud your anthems raise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Like a mighty army moves the church of God;<br/>
Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.<br/>
We are not divided, all one body we,<br/>
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
What the saints established that I hold for true.<br/>
What the saints believèd, that I believe too.<br/>
Long as earth endureth, men the faith will hold,<br/>
Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,<br/>
But the church of Jesus constant will remain.<br/>
Gates of hell can never gainst that church prevail;<br/>
We have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,<br/>
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.<br/>
Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King,<br/>
This through countless ages men and angels sing.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
