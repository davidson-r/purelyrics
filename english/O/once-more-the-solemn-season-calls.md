title: Once More The Solemn Season Calls
---

<center>
Once more the solemn season calls<br/>
A holy fast to keep;<br/>
And now within the temple walls<br/>
Let priest and people weep.<br/>
<br/>
But vain all outward sign of grief,<br/>
And vain the form of prayer,<br/>
Unless the heart implore relief,<br/>
And penitence be there.<br/>
<br/>
We smite the breast, we weep in vain,<br/>
In vain in ashes mourn,<br/>
Unless with penitential pain<br/>
The smitten soul be torn.<br/>
<br/>
In sorrow true then let us pray<br/>
To our offended God,<br/>
From us to turn His wrath away<br/>
And stay the uplifted rod.<br/>
<br/>
O God, our Judge and Father, deign<br/>
To spare the bruis√®d reed;<br/>
We pray for time to turn again,<br/>
For grace to turn indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Three in One to Thee we bow;<br/>
Vouchsafe us, in Thy love,<br/>
To gather from these fasts below<br/>
Immortal fruit above.
