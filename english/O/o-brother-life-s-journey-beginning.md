<br/>
O brother, life’s journey beginning,<br/>
With courage and firmness arise!<br/>
Look well to the course thou art choosing;<br/>
Be earnest, be watchful, and wise!<br/>
Remember two paths are before thee,<br/>
And both thy attention invite;<br/>
But one leadeth on to destruction,<br/>
The other to joy and delight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God help you to follow His banner,<br/>
And serve Him wherever you go;<br/>
And when you are tempted, my brother,<br/>
God give you the grace to say “No!”<br/>
<br/>
O brother, yield not to the tempter,<br/>
No matter what others may do;<br/>
Stand firm in the strength of the Master,<br/>
Be loyal, be faithful, and true!<br/>
Each trial will make you the stronger,<br/>
If you, in the name of the Lord,<br/>
Fight manfully under your Leader,<br/>
Obeying the voice of His Word.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O brother, the Savior is calling!<br/>
Beware of the danger of sin;<br/>
Resist not the voice of the Spirit,<br/>
That whispers so gently within.<br/>
God calls you to enter His service<br/>
To live for Him here, day by day;<br/>
And share by and by in the glory<br/>
That never shall vanish away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
