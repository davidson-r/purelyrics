title: Once He Came In Blessing

<br/>
Once He came in blessing,<br/>
All our ills redressing,<br/>
Came in likeness lowly,<br/>
Son of God most holy;<br/>
Bore the cross to save us,<br/>
Hope and freedom gave us.<br/>
<br/>
Still He comes within us,<br/>
Still His voice would win us<br/>
From the sins that hurt us;<br/>
Would to truth convert us<br/>
From our foolish errors,<br/>
Ere He comes in terrors.<br/>
<br/>
Thus if Thou hast known Him,<br/>
Not ashamed to own Him,<br/>
Nor dost love Him coldly,<br/>
But will trust Him boldly,<br/>
He will now receive thee,<br/>
Heal thee, and forgive thee.<br/>
<br/>
He who well endureth,<br/>
Bright reward secureth;<br/>
Come, then, O Lord Jesus,<br/>
From our sins release us;<br/>
Let us here confess Thee,<br/>
Till in Heavâ€™n we bless Thee.<br/>
