title: O Lord While We Confess The Worth

<center>
O Lord, while we confess the worth<br/>
Of this the outward seal,<br/>
Do Thou the truths herein set forth<br/>
To every heart reveal.<br/>
<br/>
Death to the world we here avow,<br/>
Death to each fleshly lust;<br/>
Newness of life our calling now,<br/>
A risen Lord our trust.<br/>
<br/>
And we, O Lord, who now partake<br/>
Of resurrection life,<br/>
With every sin, for Thy dear sake,<br/>
Would be at constant strife.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized into the Father’s Name,<br/>
We’d walk as sons of God;<br/>
Baptized in Thine, we own Thy claim<br/>
As ransomed by Thy blood.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized into the Holy Ghost,<br/>
We’d keep His temple pure,<br/>
And make Thy grace our only boast,<br/>
And by Thy strength endure.
