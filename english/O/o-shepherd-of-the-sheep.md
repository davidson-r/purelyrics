<br/>
O Shepherd of the sheep,<br/>
High Priest of things to come,<br/>
Who didst in grace Thy servant keep,<br/>
And take him safely home;<br/>
<br/>
Accept our song of praise<br/>
For all his holy care,<br/>
His zeal unquenched through length of days,<br/>
The trials that he bare.<br/>
<br/>
Chief of Thy faithful band,<br/>
He held himself the least,<br/>
Though Thy dread keys were in his hand,<br/>
O everlasting Priest.<br/>
<br/>
So, trusting in Thy might,<br/>
He won a fair renown;<br/>
So, waxing valiant in the fight,<br/>
He trod the lion down.<br/>
<br/>
Then rendered up to Thee<br/>
The charge Thy love had given,<br/>
And passed away Thy face to see<br/>
Revealed in highest Heav’n.<br/>
<br/>
On all our bishops pour<br/>
The Spirit of Thy grace;<br/>
That, as he won the palm of yore,<br/>
So they may run their race.<br/>
<br/>
That, when this life is done,<br/>
They may with him adore<br/>
The ever blessèd Three in One,<br/>
In bliss forevermore.<br/>
