<br/>
O God of love, to Thee we bow,<br/>
And pray for these before Thee now,<br/>
That, closely knit in holy vow,<br/>
They may be in Thee one.<br/>
<br/>
When days are filled with pure delight,<br/>
When paths are plain and skies are bright,<br/>
Walking by faith and not by sight,<br/>
May they be in Thee one.<br/>
<br/>
When stormy winds fulfill Thy will,<br/>
And all their good seems turned to ill,<br/>
Then, trusting in Thee completely, still<br/>
May they be in Thee one.<br/>
<br/>
Whateâ€™er in life shall be their share<br/>
Of quickening joy or burdening care,<br/>
In power to do and grace to bear,<br/>
May they be in Thee one.<br/>
