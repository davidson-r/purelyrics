What is the song the angels sing?<br/>
Sweetly sing, gladly sing;<br/>
What is the song the angels sing,<br/>
On a Christmas morning?<br/>
O, “Peace on earth,” the angels sing,<br/>
Sweetly sing, gladly sing,<br/>
O, “Peace on earth,” the angels sing,<br/>
On a Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O blessèd morn! O wondrous King!<br/>
A Savior born, the Lord’s anointed,<br/>
Enters on the work appointed,<br/>
Leaves the heav’nly world awhile,<br/>
God and man to reconcile.<br/>
(repeat)<br/>
<br/>
What is the blessing angels bring?<br/>
Gladly bring, truly bring;<br/>
What is the blessing angels bring,<br/>
On a Christmas morning?<br/>
“Good will to men,” the angels bring,<br/>
Gladly bring, truly bring;<br/>
“Good will to men,” the angels bring,<br/>
On a Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O, tell me why should children sing?<br/>
Sweetly sing, gladly sing;<br/>
O, tell me why should children sing,<br/>
On a Christmas morning?<br/>
In Bethlehem was born a King,<br/>
Children’s King, angels’ King;<br/>
In Bethlehem was born a King,<br/>
On a Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then let us all together sing,<br/>
Sweetly sing, gladly sing;<br/>
Then let us all together sing,<br/>
On this Christmas morning.<br/>
Glory to Him Whom love did bring,<br/>
Sweetly bring, gladly bring;<br/>
Glory to Him Whom love did bring,<br/>
On this Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
