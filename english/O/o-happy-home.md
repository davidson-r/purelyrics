O happy home, where Thou art loved the dearest,<br/>
Thou loving Friend and Savior of our race,<br/>
And where among the guests there never cometh<br/>
One who can hold such high and honored place!<br/>
<br/>
O happy home, where two in heart united<br/>
In holy faith and blessèd hope are one,<br/>
Whom death a little while alone divideth,<br/>
And cannot end the union here begun!<br/>
<br/>
O happy home, whose little ones are given<br/>
Early to Thee, in humble faith and prayer,<br/>
To Thee, their Friend, who from the heights of Heaven<br/>
Guides them, and guards with more than mother’s care!<br/>
<br/>
O happy home, where each one serves Thee, lowly,<br/>
Whatever his appointed work may be,<br/>
Till every common task seems great and holy,<br/>
When it is done, O Lord, as unto Thee!<br/>
<br/>
O happy home, where Thou art not forgotten,<br/>
Where joy is overflowing, full and free,<br/>
O happy home, where every wounded spirit<br/>
Is brought, Physician, Comforter, to Thee—<br/>
<br/>
Until at last, when earth’s day’s work is ended,<br/>
All meet Thee in the blessèd home above,<br/>
From whence Thou camest, where Thou hast ascended,<br/>
Thy everlasting home of peace and love!
