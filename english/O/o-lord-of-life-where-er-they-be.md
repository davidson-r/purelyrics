<br/>
O Lord of life, where’er they be,<br/>
Safe in Thine own eternity,<br/>
Our dead are living unto Thee:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
All souls are Thine, and here or there<br/>
They rest within Thy sheltering care;<br/>
One providence alike they share:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
Thy Word is true, Thy ways are just;<br/>
Above the requiem, “Dust to dust,”<br/>
Shall rise our psalm of grateful trust:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
O happy they in God who rest,<br/>
No more by fear and doubt oppressed,<br/>
Living or dying, they are blest:<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
