title: O Thou Who Camest From Above

<center>
<br/>
O thou who camest from above<br/>
the fire celestial to impart,<br/>
kindle a flame of sacred love<br/>
on the mean altar of my heart.<br/>
<br/>
There let it for thy glory burn<br/>
with inextinguishable blaze,<br/>
and trembling to its source return<br/>
in humble prayer and fervent praise.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, confirm my heart's desire<br/>
to work and speak and think for thee;<br/>
still let me guard the holy fire<br/>
and still stir up the gift in me.<br/>
<br/>
Still let me prove thy perfect will,<br/>
my acts of faith and love repeat,<br/>
till death thy endless mercies seal,<br/>
and make the sacrifice complete.<br/>

</center>
