title: On The Good And Faithful

<br/>
On the good and faithful God has set His love;<br/>
When they call He sends them blessings from above.<br/>
Stand in awe, and sin not, bid your heart be still;<br/>
Through the silent watches think upon His will.<br/>
<br/>
Lay upon God’s altar good and loving deeds,<br/>
And in all things trust Him to supply your needs.<br/>
Anxious and despairing, many walk in night;<br/>
But to those that fear Him God will send His light.<br/>
<br/>
In God’s love abiding, I have joy and peace<br/>
More than all the wicked, though their wealth increase.<br/>
In His care confiding, I will sweetly sleep.<br/>
For the Lord, my Savior, will in safety keep.<br/>
