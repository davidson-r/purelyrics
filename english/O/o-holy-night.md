<br/>
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining, <br/>
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth. <br/>
Long lay the world in sin and error pining. <br/>
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. <br/>
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, <br/>
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. <br/>
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! <br/>
O night divine, the night when Christ was born; <br/>
O night, O holy night, O night divine! <br/>
O night, O holy night, O night divine! <br/>
<br/>
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, <br/>
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. <br/>
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, <br/>
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land. <br/>
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger; <br/>
In all our trials born to be our friends. <br/>
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, <br/>
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! <br/>
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! <br/>
<br/>
Truly He taught us to love one another, <br/>
His law is love and His gospel is peace. <br/>
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. <br/>
And in his name all oppression shall cease. <br/>
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, <br/>
With all our hearts we praise His holy name. <br/>
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we, <br/>
His power and glory ever more proclaim! <br/>
His power and glory ever more proclaim!<br/>
