<br/>
O Lord of life, Thy quickening voice,<br/>
Awakes my morning song!<br/>
In gladsome words I would rejoice<br/>
That I to Thee belong.<br/>
<br/>
I see Thy light, I feel thy wind;<br/>
The world it is Thy Word;<br/>
Whatever wakes my heart and mind<br/>
Thy presence is, my Lord.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I choose my highest part,<br/>
And turn my face to Thee;<br/>
Therefore I stir my inmost heart<br/>
To worship fervently.<br/>
