<br/>
Our God of love, Who reigns above,<br/>
Comes down to us below;<br/>
’Tis sweet to tell He loves so well,<br/>
And ’tis enough to know.<br/>
<br/>
So deep, so highlike air and sky,<br/>
Beyond us, yet around;<br/>
He Whom our mind can never find<br/>
Can in our heart be found.<br/>
<br/>
Lord God, so far, past sun and star,<br/>
Yet close to all our ways!<br/>
In love so near, be pleased to hear<br/>
Thy little children’s praise.<br/>
<br/>
O may that sign that we are Thine<br/>
Our Father, Savior, Friend<br/>
Which sealed our brow, be on us now,<br/>
And with us to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Through all our way, and every day<br/>
Believed, beloved, adored;<br/>
Be this our grace, to see Thy face<br/>
In Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/>
