title: Oh How Sweet When We Mingle

<br/>
Oh, how sweet when we mingle with kindred spirits here,<br/>
And tell of Jesus and His love!<br/>
When by faith we can see Him, and feel His presence near,<br/>
And lift our longing souls above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We shall meet on the banks of the river,<br/>
Happy, happy there forevermore!<br/>
We shall dwell with the angels, and join with choral song,<br/>
Our loved ones, loved ones gone before.<br/>
<br/>
We are pilgrims of Zion, though trials we must bear,<br/>
Which all are blessings in disguise:<br/>
Though the cross may be heavy, the crown we soon shall wear<br/>
In Heavâ€™n, where pleasure never dies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When we walk through the valley and shadow of the tomb,<br/>
Dear Savior, Thou wilt be our Guide:<br/>
And Thy smile like a sunbeam will light beyond the gloom,<br/>
And keep Thy people at Thy side.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
