<br/>
O sing a song of Bethlehem, of shepherds watching there,<br/>
And of the news that came to them from angels in the air.<br/>
The light that shone on Bethlehem fills all the world today;<br/>
Of Jesus’ birth and peace on earth the angels sing alway.<br/>
<br/>
O sing a song of Nazareth, of sunny days of joy;<br/>
O sing of fragrant flowers’ breath, and of the sinless Boy.<br/>
For now the flowers of Nazareth in every heart may grow;<br/>
Now spreads the fame of His dear Name on all the winds that blow.<br/>
<br/>
O sing a song of Galilee, of lake and woods and hill,<br/>
Of Him Who walked upon the sea and bade the waves be still.<br/>
For though like waves on Galilee, dark seas of trouble roll,<br/>
When faith has heard the Master’s Word, falls peace upon the soul.<br/>
<br/>
O sing a song of Calvary, its glory and dismay,<br/>
Of Him who hung upon the tree, and took our sins away.<br/>
For He who died on Calvary is risen from the grave,<br/>
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored, is mighty now to save.<br/>
