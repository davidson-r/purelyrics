<br/>
Oh realm of light! whose morning star<br/>
To Bethlehem’s manger led the way,<br/>
Not yet upon our longing eyes<br/>
Shines the full splendor of thy day:<br/>
Yet still across the centuries fall,<br/>
Both strong and sweet, our Lord’s command;<br/>
And still with steadfast faith we cry,<br/>
“Behold, the kingdom is at hand!”<br/>
<br/>
Oh realm of Heav’n! whose dawn began<br/>
With love’s divine, incarnate breath,<br/>
Our hearts were slow to understand<br/>
The lessons of that life and death:<br/>
Yet though with stammering tongues we tell<br/>
Redemption’s story, strange and sweet,<br/>
The world’s Redeemer, lifted up<br/>
Shall draw the nations to His feet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh realm of peace! whose music clear<br/>
Swept through Judea’s starlit skies,<br/>
Still the harsh sounds of human strife<br/>
Break on thy heavenly harmonies;<br/>
Yet shall thy song of triumph ring<br/>
In full accord, from land to land,<br/>
And men with angels learn to sing,<br/>
“Behold, the kingdom is at hand!”<br/>
