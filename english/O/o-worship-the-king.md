<br/>
O worship the King<br/>
All glorious above;<br/>
O gratefully sing<br/>
His power and his love:<br/>
Our Shield and Defender,<br/>
The Ancient of days,<br/>
Pavilioned in splendour,<br/>
And girded with praise.<br/>
<br/>
O tell of his might,<br/>
O sing of his grace,<br/>
Whose robe is the light,<br/>
Whose canopy space.<br/>
His chariots of wrath<br/>
The deep thunder-clouds form,<br/>
And dark is his path<br/>
On the wings of the storm.<br/>
<br/>
This earth, with its store<br/>
Of wonders untold,<br/>
Almighty, thy power<br/>
Hath founded of old:<br/>
Hath stablished it fast<br/>
By a changeless decree,<br/>
And round it hath cast,<br/>
Like a mantle, the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Thy bountiful care<br/>
What tongue can recite?<br/>
It breathes in the air,<br/>
It shines in the light;<br/>
It streams from the hills,<br/>
It descends to the plain,<br/>
And sweetly distils<br/>
In the dew and the rain.<br/>
<br/>
Frail children of dust,<br/>
And feeble as frail,<br/>
In thee do we trust,<br/>
Nor find thee to fail;<br/>
Thy mercies how tender!<br/>
How firm to the end!<br/>
Our Maker, Defender,<br/>
Redeemer, and Friend.<br/>
<br/>
O measureless Might,<br/>
Ineffable Love,<br/>
While angels delight<br/>
To hymn thee above,<br/>
Thy humbler creation,<br/>
Though feeble their lays,<br/>
With true adoration<br/>
Shall sing to thy praise.<br/>
