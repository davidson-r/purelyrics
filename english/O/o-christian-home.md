<br/>
O Christian home, you humble place,<br/>
Where God’s own kingdom grows, by grace,<br/>
With Christ himself as head—<br/>
In you live bold and steadfast men<br/>
And wives who guard their hearts from sin<br/>
As both by Christ are led.<br/>
<br/>
In you a man may love his bride<br/>
Enough to be her guard and guide,<br/>
And rule with tender heart.<br/>
And wives will gladly work in you<br/>
To aid the good their husbands do—<br/>
Delighted in their part.<br/>
<br/>
For Christian homes have jobs for all.<br/>
If one’s undone, the house may fall,<br/>
Though be it help or head.<br/>
And there a child will know his place:<br/>
The seed of Abrah’m, marked for grace,<br/>
And loved, as our Lord said:<br/>
<br/>
“For such do fill the Land of God,”<br/>
Where we’ll need no firm words, no rod<br/>
To put us in our place.<br/>
There husbands, wives, sons, daughters we<br/>
Like children safe at home will be,<br/>
For we are called by grace. <br/>
