title: O That Will Be Glory

<center>
<br/>
When all my labors and trials are oâ€™er,<br/>
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,<br/>
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,<br/>
Will through the ages be glory for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O that will be glory for me,<br/>
Glory for me, glory for me,<br/>
When by His grace I shall look on His face,<br/>
That will be glory, be glory for me.<br/>
<br/>
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,<br/>
I am accorded in Heaven a place,<br/>
Just to be there and to look on His face,<br/>
Will through the ages be glory for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;<br/>
Joy like a river around me will flow;<br/>
Yet just a smile from my Savior, I know,<br/>
Will through the ages be glory for me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
