O Lord, to Whom the spirits live<br/>
Of all the faithful passed away,<br/>
Unto their path that brightness give<br/>
Which shineth to the perfect day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O Lamb of God, Redeemer blest,<br/>
Grant them eternal light and rest.<br/>
<br/>
Bless Thou the dead which die in Thee;<br/>
As Thou hast given them release;<br/>
So quicken them Thy face to see,<br/>
And give them everlasting peace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
In Thy green, pleasant pastures feed<br/>
The sheep which Thou hast summoned hence;<br/>
And by the still, cool waters lead<br/>
Thy flock in loving providence.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How long, O Holy Lord, how long<br/>
Must we and they expectant wait<br/>
To hear the gladsome bridal song,<br/>
To see Thee in Thy royal state?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O hearken, Savior, to their cry,<br/>
O rend the heavens and come down,<br/>
Make up the jewels speedily,<br/>
And set them in Thy golden crown.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Direct us with Thine arm of might,<br/>
And bring us, perfected with them,<br/>
To dwell within Thy city bright,<br/>
The heavenly Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
