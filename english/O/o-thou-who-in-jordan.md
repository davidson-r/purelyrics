title: O Thou Who In Jordan

<br/>
O Thou Who in Jordan didst bow Thy meek head,<br/>
And, â€™whelmed in our sorrow, didst sink to the dead,<br/>
Then rose from the darkness to glory above,<br/>
And claimed for Thy chosen the kingdom of love.<br/>
<br/>
Thy footsteps we follow, to bow in the tide,<br/>
And are buried with Thee in the death Thou hast died;<br/>
Then wake in Thy likeness to walk in the way<br/>
That brightens and brightens to shadowless day.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, our Savior, O Jesus, our Lord,<br/>
By the life of Thy passion, the grace of Thy Word,<br/>
Accept us, redeem us, dwell ever within,<br/>
To keep, by Thy Spirit, our spirits from sin.<br/>
<br/>
Till, crowned with Thy glory, and waving the palm,<br/>
Our garments all white from the blood of the Lamb,<br/>
We join the bright millions of saints gone before,<br/>
To bless Thee, and wonder, and praise evermore.<br/>
