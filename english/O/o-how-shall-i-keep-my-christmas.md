“O how shall I keep my Christmas?”<br/>
My heart whispered softly to me,<br/>
For I had been reading the story<br/>
Of the Lord’s nativity;<br/>
And slowly and clearly before me<br/>
The words like pictures rise,<br/>
And the scenes appear in the beauty<br/>
Of the starry Syrian skies.<br/>
<br/>
O cradled He was in a manger!<br/>
For lowly and poor was He,<br/>
Whose throne is the splendors of heaven<br/>
Whose pow’r is infinity;<br/>
And He bore His cross to save us,<br/>
To save us from death and sin,<br/>
And He trod all alone the winepress<br/>
To make us pure and clean.<br/>
<br/>
In glory the hosts of the angels<br/>
Came singing His song of praise,<br/>
And filling the heav’ns with their music<br/>
In those wonderful old days;<br/>
Singing “Glory to God in the highest!”<br/>
And “peace upon earth,”<br/>
And the mighty chorus of voices<br/>
Pealed forth “Good will to all.”<br/>
<br/>
“O how shall I keep my Christmas?”<br/>
As they keep it in heaven above;<br/>
O keep it with peace and thanksgiving,<br/>
And kindliest deed of love;<br/>
And share with the poor and needy<br/>
The joys which the Lord gives thee;<br/>
And thy heart shall keep with the angels<br/>
The Lord’s nativity.
