O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy leaves are so unchanging;<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy leaves are so unchanging;<br/>
Not only green when summer's here,<br/>
But also when 'tis cold and drear.<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy leaves are so unchanging!<br/>
<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Much pleasure thou can'st give me;<br/>
How often has the Christmas tree<br/>
Afforded me the greatest glee!<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Much pleasure thou can'st give me.<br/>
<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy candles shine so brightly!<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy candles shine so brightly!<br/>
From base to summit, gay and bright,<br/>
There's only splendor for the sight.<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
Thy candles shine so brightly!<br/>
<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
How richly God has decked thee!<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
How richly God has decked thee!<br/>
Thou bidst us true and faithful be,<br/>
And trust in God unchangingly.<br/>
O Christmas Tree! O Christmas Tree!<br/>
How richly God has decked thee! !"
