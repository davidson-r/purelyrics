<br/>
O praise ye the Lord! Praise Him in the height; <br/>
Rejoice in his word, ye angels of light; <br/>
Ye heavens adore him by whom ye were made, <br/>
And worship before him, in brightness arrayed.<br/>
<br/>
O praise ye the Lord! Praise him upon earth, <br/>
In tuneful accord, ye sons of new birth; <br/>
Praise him who hath brought you his grace from above, <br/>
Praise him who hath taught you to sing of his love.<br/>
<br/>
O praise ye the Lord, all things that give sound; <br/>
Each jubilant chord re-echo around; <br/>
Loud organs, his glory forth tell in deep tone, <br/>
And, sweet harp, the story of what he hath done.<br/>
<br/>
O praise ye the Lord! Thanksgiving and song <br/>
To him be outpoured all ages along: <br/>
For love in creation, for heaven restored, <br/>
For grace of salvation, O praise ye the Lord! <br/>
