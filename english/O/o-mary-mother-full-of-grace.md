<br/>
O Mary, Mother full of grace,<br/>
Mother of love and mercy, hear!<br/>
Help us our enemy to face,<br/>
And at the hour of death be near. <br/>
<br/>
Eternal praise to Thee,O Lord,<br/>
Born of a Virgin ever pure;<br/>
Praise to the holy Trinity<br/>
While endless ages yet endure. <br/>
<br/>
Amen.Â  <br/>
