title: O Darkest Woe

O darkest woe! Ye tears, forth flow!<br/>
Has earth so sad a wonder?<br/>
God the Father’s only Son<br/>
Now lies buried yonder.<br/>
<br/>
O sorrow dread!<br/>
God’s Son is dead!<br/>
But by His expiation<br/>
Of our guilt upon the cross<br/>
Gained for us salvation.<br/>
<br/>
O sinful man, it was the ban<br/>
Of death on thee that brought Him<br/>
Down to suffer for thy sins,<br/>
And such woe hath wrought Him.<br/>
<br/>
Behold thy Lord, the Lamb of God<br/>
Blood sprinkled lies before thee,<br/>
Pouring out His life that He<br/>
May to life restore thee.<br/>
<br/>
O Ground of faith,<br/>
Laid low in death,<br/>
Sweet lips, now silent sleeping!<br/>
Surely all that live must mourn<br/>
Here with bitter weeping.<br/>
<br/>
O blest shall be<br/>
Eternally<br/>
Who oft in faith will ponder<br/>
Why the glorious Prince of Life<br/>
Should be buried yonder.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus blest, my Help and Rest!<br/>
With tears I pray, Lord hear me,<br/>
Make me love Thee to the last,<br/>
And in death be near me.
