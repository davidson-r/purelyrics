Once in royal Davids city,<br/>
Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br/>
Where a mother laid her Baby,<br/>
In a manger for His bed:<br/>
Mary was that mother mild,<br/>
Jesus Christ, her little Child.<br/>
<br/>
He came down to earth from heaven,<br/>
Who is God and Lord of all,<br/>
And His shelter was a stable,<br/>
And His cradle was a stall:<br/>
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br/>
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.<br/>
<br/>
For He is our childhood's pattern;<br/>
Day by day, like us, He grew;<br/>
He was little, weak, and helpless,<br/>
Tears and smiles, like us He knew;<br/>
And He cares when we are sad,<br/>
And he shares when we are glad.<br/>
<br/>
And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br/>
Through His own redeeming love;<br/>
For that Child so dear and gentle,<br/>
Is our Lord in heaven above:<br/>
And He leads His children on,<br/>
To the place where He is gone.
