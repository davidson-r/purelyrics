<br/>
O Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end;<br/>
Be Thou forever near me, my Master and my Friend;<br/>
I shall not fear the battle if Thou art by my side,<br/>
Nor wander from the pathway if Thou wilt be my Guide.<br/>
<br/>
O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever near;<br/>
I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear;<br/>
My foes are ever near me, around me and within;<br/>
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.<br/>
<br/>
O let me hear Thee speaking in accents clear and still,<br/>
Above the storms of passion, the murmurs of self will.<br/>
O speak to reassure me, to hasten or control;<br/>
O speak, and make me listen, Thou Guardian of my soul.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, Thou hast promised to all who follow Thee<br/>
That where Thou art in glory there shall Thy servant be.<br/>
And Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end;<br/>
O give me grace to follow, my Master and my Friend.<br/>
<br/>
O let me see Thy footprints, and in them plant mine own;<br/>
My hope to follow duly is in Thy strength alone.<br/>
O guide me, call me, draw me, uphold me to the end;<br/>
And then in Heaven receive me, my Savior and my Friend.<br/>
