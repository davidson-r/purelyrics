<br/>
O King Enthroned On High,<br/>
Thou Comforter Divine,<br/>
Blest Spirit Of All Truth, Be Nigh<br/>
And Make Us Thine.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Art The Source Of Life,<br/>
Thou Art Our Treasure-Store;<br/>
Give Us Thy Peace And End Our Strife<br/>
For Evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Descend, O Heavenly Dove,<br/>
Abide With Us Alway;<br/>
And In The Fullness Of Thy Love,<br/>
Cleanse Us, We Pray.<br/>
