<br/>
O Queen of the Holy Rosary, <br/>
O bless us as we pray,<br/>
And offer thee our roses <br/>
In garlands day by day,<br/>
While from our Father's garden, <br/>
With loving hearts and bold,<br/>
We gather to thine honor <br/>
Buds white and red and gold. <br/>
<br/>
O Queen of the Holy Rosary, <br/>
Each myst'ry blends with thine<br/>
The sacred life of Jesus <br/>
In ev'ry step divine,<br/>
Thy soul was His fair garden, <br/>
Thy virgin breast His throne,<br/>
Thy thoughts His faithful mirror, <br/>
Reflecting Him alone. <br/>
<br/>
O Queen of the Holy Rosary,<br/>
We share thy joy and pain,<br/>
And long to see the glory<br/>
Of Christ's triumphant reign.<br/>
Oh, teach us holy Mary,<br/>
To live each mystery,<br/>
And gain by patient suff'ring<br/>
The glory won by thee. <br/>
