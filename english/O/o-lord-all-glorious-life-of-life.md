<br/>
O Lord, all glorious, Life of life!<br/>
To Thee we raise our grateful song;<br/>
Lift up our souls from thoughts of self<br/>
To Thee, to Whom all lives belong.<br/>
<br/>
Below all depths Thy mercy lies,<br/>
Above all heights Thy love ascends;<br/>
Thy providence our path surrounds,<br/>
Thy watchful care each step attends.<br/>
<br/>
From Thee all good desires proceed,<br/>
All holy thoughts we gain from Thee;<br/>
The good we do is Thine alone,<br/>
Thine shall our heartâ€™s thanksgiving be.<br/>
