title: O Valiant Hearts

<center>
O valiant hearts who to your glory came<br/>
Through dust of conflict and through battle flame;<br/>
Tranquil you lie, your knightly virtue proved,<br/>
Your memory hallowed in the land you loved.<br/>
<br/>
Proudly you gathered, rank on rank, to war<br/>
As who had heard God’s message from afar;<br/>
All you had hoped for, all you had, you gave,<br/>
To save mankind—yourselves you scorned to save.<br/>
<br/>
Splendid you passed, the great surrender made;<br/>
Into the light that nevermore shall fade;<br/>
Deep your contentment in that blest abode,<br/>
Who wait the last clear trumpet call of God.<br/>
<br/>
Long years ago, as earth lay dark and still,<br/>
Rose a loud cry upon a lonely hill,<br/>
While in the frailty of our human clay,<br/>
Christ, our Redeemer, passed the self same way.<br/>
<br/>
Still stands His Cross from that dread hour to this,<br/>
Like some bright star above the dark abyss;<br/>
Still, through the veil, the Victor’s pitying eyes<br/>
Look down to bless our lesser Calvaries.<br/>
<br/>
These were His servants, in His steps they trod,<br/>
Following through death the martyred Son of God:<br/>
Victor, He rose; victorious too shall rise<br/>
They who have drunk His cup of sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
O risen Lord, O Shepherd of our dead,<br/>
Whose cross has bought them and Whose staff has led,<br/>
In glorious hope their proud and sorrowing land<br/>
Commits her children to Thy gracious hand.
