<br/>
O heavenly Word, eternal Light,<br/>
Begotten of the Father’s might,<br/>
Who, in these latter days, art born<br/>
For succor to a world forlorn;<br/>
<br/>
Our hearts enlighten from above,<br/>
And kindle with Thine own true love;<br/>
That we, who hear Thy call today,<br/>
May cast earth’s vanities away.<br/>
<br/>
And when as Judge Thou drawest nigh,<br/>
The secrets of all hearts to try;<br/>
When sinners meet their awful doom,<br/>
And saints attain their heavenly home;<br/>
<br/>
O let us not, for evil past,<br/>
Be driven from Thy face at last;<br/>
But with the blessèd evermore<br/>
Behold Thee, love Thee, and adore.<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father, God the Son,<br/>
And God the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
Praise, honor, might and glory be<br/>
From age to age eternally.<br/>
