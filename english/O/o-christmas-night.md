title: O Christmas night

O Christmas night! Day’s light transcending,<br/>
Who no beginning had or end<br/>
Till He a man became, was God.<br/>
Then He Who ne’er before was human<br/>
Was born in Bethlehem of woman,<br/>
When nips the frost the verdant sod.<br/>
<br/>
This richest Babe comes poor in being,<br/>
More pearled within than to the seeing<br/>
With diadem and royal power;<br/>
He takes no heed of greater places,<br/>
But that small spot alone embraces,<br/>
Where light illumes the midnight hour.<br/>
<br/>
This Prince, do they desire to find Him?<br/>
They’re worn out swaddling clothes that bind Him.<br/>
A manger, spread with hay’s His bed.<br/>
His throne is higher than the highest,<br/>
Yet He among the cattle lieth;<br/>
What Him to such a lot has led?<br/>
<br/>
Now seeks He God with chaste affection<br/>
Who takes before such crib direction,<br/>
Are better than this Bethlehem,<br/>
Which Christ no resting place shall give;<br/>
For they, the after life, shall live<br/>
With Him, in Jerusalem.
