O God of truth, Whose living Word<br/>
Upholds whate’er hath breath,<br/>
Look down on Thy creation, Lord,<br/>
Enslaved by sin and death.<br/>
<br/>
Set up Thy standard, Lord, that we,<br/>
Who claim a heavenly birth,<br/>
May march with Thee to smite the lies<br/>
That vex Thy groaning earth.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! would we join that blest array,<br/>
And follow in the might<br/>
Of Him, the Faithful and the True,<br/>
In raiment clean and white!<br/>
<br/>
We fight for truth, we fight for God,<br/>
Poor slaves of lies and sin!<br/>
He who would fight for Thee on earth<br/>
Must first be true within.<br/>
<br/>
Then, God of truth, for Whom we long,<br/>
Thou Who wilt hear our prayer,<br/>
Do Thine own battle in our hearts,<br/>
And slay the falsehood there.<br/>
<br/>
Still smite; still burn; till naught is left<br/>
But God’s own truth and love;<br/>
Then, Lord, as morning dew come down,<br/>
Rest on us from above.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, come: then, tried as in the fire,<br/>
From every lie set free,<br/>
Thy perfect truth shall dwell in us,<br/>
And we shall live in Thee.
