<center>
On the resurrection morning,<br/>
Soul and body meet again,<br/>
No more sorrow, no more weeping,<br/>
No more pain.<br/>
<br/>
Here awhile they must be parted,<br/>
And the flesh its Sabbath keep,<br/>
Waiting in a holy stillness,<br/>
Wrapped in sleep.<br/>
<br/>
For a while the wearied body<br/>
Lies with feet toward the morn;<br/>
Till the last and brightest Easter<br/>
Day be born.<br/>
<br/>
But the soul in contemplation,<br/>
Utters earnest prayer and strong,<br/>
Bursting at the resurrection<br/>
Into song.<br/>
<br/>
Soul and body reunited<br/>
Thenceforth nothing shall divide,<br/>
Waking up in Christâ€™s own likeness<br/>
Satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
O the beauty, O the gladness<br/>
Of that resurrection day,<br/>
Which shall not through endless ages<br/>
Pass away!<br/>
<br/>
On that happy Easter morning<br/>
All the graves their dead restore,<br/>
Father, mother, sister, brother,<br/>
Meet once more.<br/>
<br/>
To that brightest of all meetings<br/>
Bring us, Jesus Christ, at last,<br/>
By thy cross, through death and judgment,<br/>
Holding fast.
