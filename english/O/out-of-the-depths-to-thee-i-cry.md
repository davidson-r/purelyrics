title: Out Of The Depths To Thee I Cry

<br/>
Out of the depths to Thee I cry,<br/>
Whose fainting footsteps trod<br/>
The paths of our humanity,<br/>
Incarnate Son of God!<br/>
<br/>
Thou Man of grief, Who once apart<br/>
Didst all our sorrows bear,<br/>
The trembling hand, the fainting heart<br/>
The agony, and prayer!<br/>
<br/>
Is this the consecrated dower,<br/>
Thy chosen ones obtain,<br/>
To know Thy resurrection power<br/>
Through fellowship of pain?<br/>
<br/>
Then, O my soul, in silence wait;<br/>
Faint not, O faltering feet;<br/>
Press onward to that blest estate,<br/>
In righteousness complete.<br/>
<br/>
Let faith transcend the passing hour,<br/>
The transient pain and strife,<br/>
Upraised by an immortal power,<br/>
The power of endless life.<br/>
