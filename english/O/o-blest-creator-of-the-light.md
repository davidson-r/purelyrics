<br/>
O blest Creator of the light,<br/>
Who mak’st the day with radiance bright,<br/>
And o’er the forming world didst call<br/>
The light from chaos first of all.<br/>
<br/>
Whose wisdom joined in meet array<br/>
The morn and eve, and named them day:<br/>
Night comes with all its darkling fears;<br/>
Regard Thy people’s prayers and tears.<br/>
<br/>
Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife,<br/>
They lose the gift of endless life;<br/>
While thinking but the thoughts of time,<br/>
They weave new chains of woe and crime.<br/>
<br/>
But grant them grace that they may strain<br/>
The heavenly gate and prize to gain:<br/>
Each harmful lure aside to cast,<br/>
And purge away each error past.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, that we ask be done,<br/>
Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son;<br/>
Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,<br/>
Doth live and reign eternally.<br/>
