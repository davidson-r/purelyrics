<br/>
On the birthday of the Lord<br/>
Angels joy in glad accord,<br/>
And they sing in sweetest tone,<br/>
Glory be to God alone,<br/>
Glory be to God alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
God is born of maiden fair,<br/>
Mary doth the Savior bear;<br/>
Mary ever pure, Mary ever pure.<br/>
<br/>
These good news an angel told<br/>
To the shepherds by their fold,<br/>
Told them of the Savior’s birth,<br/>
Told them of the joy for earth,<br/>
Told them of the joy for earth.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Born is now Emmanuel,<br/>
He, announced by Gabriel,<br/>
He, Whom prophets old attest,<br/>
Cometh from His Father’s breast,<br/>
Cometh from His Father’s breast.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Born today is Christ the Child,<br/>
Born of Mary undefiled,<br/>
Born the King and Lord we own;<br/>
Glory be to God alone,<br/>
Glory be to God alone.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
