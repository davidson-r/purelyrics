title: O Thou Who Turnest Into Morning

<br/>
O Thou Who turnest into morning<br/>
The shadows of the passing night,<br/>
Again to conscious life returning,<br/>
We bless Thee for the newborn light.<br/>
<br/>
Grant us that light, to all unfailing<br/>
Who seek to do Thy perfect will,<br/>
That we, oâ€™er doubt and fear prevailing,<br/>
May trust Thy good above all ill;<br/>
<br/>
That we may offer Thee thanksgiving<br/>
Beyond our prayers and songs that rise<br/>
In greater faithfulness of living,<br/>
In deeper love through sacrifice.<br/>
