O Thou Who by a star didst guide<br/>
The wise men on their way,<br/>
Until it came and stood beside<br/>
The place where Jesus lay.<br/>
<br/>
Although by stars Thou dost not lead<br/>
Thy servants now below,<br/>
Thy Holy Spirit, when they need,<br/>
Will show them how to go.<br/>
<br/>
As yet we know Thee but in part;<br/>
But still we trust Thy Word,<br/>
That bless√®d are the pure in heart,<br/>
For they shall see the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
O Savior, give us then Thy grace<br/>
To make us pure in heart,<br/>
That we may see Thee face to face<br/>
Hereafter, as Thou art.<br/>
