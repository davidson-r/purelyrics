<br/>
O Canada! Our home and native land! <br/>
True patriot love in all thy sons command. <br/>
With glowing hearts we see thee rise, <br/>
The True North strong and free! <br/>
From far and wide, O Canada, <br/>
We stand on guard for thee. <br/>
God keep our land glorious and free! <br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. <br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. <br/>
<br/>
The words of the original poem of 1908 by Stanley Weir are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
O Canada! Our home and native land! <br/>
True patriot love thou dost in us command. <br/>
We see thee rising fair, dear land, <br/>
The True North, strong and free; <br/>
And stand on guard, O Canada, <br/>
We stand on guard for thee. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
O Canada! O Canada! <br/>
O Canada! We stand on guard for thee. <br/>
O Canada! We stand on guard for thee. <br/>
<br/>
O Canada! Where pines and maples grow. <br/>
Great prairies spread and lordly rivers flow. <br/>
How dear to us thy broad domain, <br/>
From East to Western Sea, <br/>
Thou land of hope for all who toil! <br/>
Thou True North, strong and free! <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
<br/>
O Canada! Beneath thy shining skies <br/>
May stalwart sons and gentle maidens rise, <br/>
To keep thee steadfast through the years <br/>
From East to Western Sea, <br/>
Our own beloved native land! <br/>
Our True North, strong and free! <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
<br/>
Ruler supreme, who hearest humble prayer, <br/>
Hold our dominion within thy loving care; <br/>
Help us to find, O God, in thee <br/>
A lasting, rich reward, <br/>
As waiting for the Better Day, <br/>
We ever stand on guard. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
