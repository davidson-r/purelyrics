title: O Jesu Christ From Thee Began

O Jesu Christ, from Thee began<br/>
This healing for the soul for man,<br/>
By fasting sought, by fasting found<br/>
Through forty days of yearly round;<br/>
<br/>
That he who fell from high delight,<br/>
Borne down to sensual appetite,<br/>
By dint of stern control may rise<br/>
To climb the hills of Paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore behold Thy Church, O Lord,<br/>
And grace of penitence accord<br/>
To all who seek with generous tears<br/>
Renewal of their wasted years.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive the sin that we have done,<br/>
Forgive the course that we have run,<br/>
And show henceforth in evil day<br/>
Thyself our succor and our stay.<br/>
<br/>
But now let every heart prepare,<br/>
By sacrifice of fast and prayer,<br/>
To keep with joy magnifical<br/>
The solemn Easter festival.<br/>
<br/>
Father and Son and Spirit blest,<br/>
To Thee be every prayer addrest,<br/>
Who art in threefold Name adored,<br/>
From age to age, the only Lord.
