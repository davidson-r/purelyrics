<br/>
1. Our Father, Thou in heaven above,<br/>
Who biddest us to dwell in love,<br/>
As brethren of one family,<br/>
To cry in every need to Thee,<br/>
Teach us no thoughtless word to say,<br/>
But from our inmost heart to pray.<br/>
<br/>
2. Thy name be hallowed. Help us, Lord,<br/>
In purity to keep Thy Word,<br/>
That to the glory of thy name<br/>
We walk before Thee free from blame.<br/>
Let no false doctrine us pervert;<br/>
All poor, deluded souls convert.<br/>
<br/>
3. Thy kingdom come. Thine let it be<br/>
In time and in eternity.<br/>
Let Thy good Spirit e'er be nigh<br/>
Our hearts with graces to supply.<br/>
Break Satan's power, defeat his rage;<br/>
Preserve Thy Church from age to age.<br/>
<br/>
4. Thy gracious will on earth be done<br/>
As 'tis in heaven before Thy throne;<br/>
Obedience in our weal and woe<br/>
And patience in all grief bestow.<br/>
Curb flesh and blood and every ill<br/>
That sets itself against Thy will.<br/>
<br/>
5. Give us this day our daily bread<br/>
And let us all be clothed and fed.<br/>
From war and strife be our Defense,<br/>
From famine and from pestilence,<br/>
That we may live in godly peace,<br/>
Free from all care and avarice.<br/>
<br/>
6. Forgive our sins, Lord, we implore,<br/>
Remove from us their burden sore,<br/>
As we their trespasses forgive<br/>
Who by offenses us do grieve.<br/>
Thus let us dwell in charity<br/>
And serve our brother willingly.<br/>
<br/>
7. Into temptation lead us not.<br/>
When evil foes against us plot<br/>
And vex our souls on every hand,<br/>
Oh, give us strength that we may stand<br/>
Firm in the faith, a well-armed host,<br/>
Through comfort of the Holy Ghost!<br/>
<br/>
8. From evil, Lord, deliver us;<br/>
The times and days are perilous.<br/>
Redeem us from eternal death,<br/>
And when we yield our dying breath,<br/>
Console us, grant us calm release,<br/>
And take our souls to Thee in peace.<br/>
<br/>
9. Amen, that is, So shall it be.<br/>
Confirm our faith and hope in Thee<br/>
That we may doubt not, but believe<br/>
What here we ask we shall receive.<br/>
Thus in Thy name and at Thy word<br/>
We say: Amen. Oh, hear us, Lord! Amen. <br/>
