<br/>
Our God, our help in ages past,<br/>
Our hope for years to come,<br/>
Our shelter from the stormy blast,<br/>
And our eternal home.<br/>
<br/>
Under the shadow of Thy throne<br/>
Thy saints have dwelt secure;<br/>
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,<br/>
And our defense is sure.<br/>
<br/>
Before the hills in order stood,<br/>
Or earth received her frame,<br/>
From everlasting Thou art God,<br/>
To endless years the same.<br/>
<br/>
Thy Word commands our flesh to dust,<br/>
“Return, ye sons of men:”<br/>
All nations rose from earth at first,<br/>
And turn to earth again.<br/>
<br/>
A thousand ages in Thy sight<br/>
Are like an evening gone;<br/>
Short as the watch that ends the night<br/>
Before the rising sun.<br/>
<br/>
The busy tribes of flesh and blood,<br/>
With all their lives and cares,<br/>
Are carried downwards by the flood,<br/>
And lost in following years.<br/>
<br/>
Time, like an ever rolling stream,<br/>
Bears all its sons away;<br/>
They fly, forgotten, as a dream<br/>
Dies at the opening day.<br/>
<br/>
Like flowery fields the nations stand<br/>
Pleased with the morning light;<br/>
The flowers beneath the mower’s hand<br/>
Lie withering ere ‘tis night.<br/>
<br/>
Our God, our help in ages past,<br/>
Our hope for years to come,<br/>
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,<br/>
And our eternal home.<br/>
