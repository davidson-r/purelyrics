title: O Render Thanks To God Above

<br/>
O render thanks to God above,<br/>
The fountain of eternal love,<br/>
Whose mercy firm through ages past<br/>
Hath stood, and shall forever last.<br/>
<br/>
Who can His mighty deeds express,<br/>
Not only vast, but numberless?<br/>
What mortal eloquence can raise<br/>
His tribute of immortal praise?<br/>
<br/>
Extend to me that favor, Lord,<br/>
Thou to Thy chosen dost afford;<br/>
When Thou return’st to set them free,<br/>
Let Thy salvation visit me.<br/>
<br/>
O may I worthy prove to see<br/>
Thy saints in full prosperity,<br/>
That I the joyful choir may join,<br/>
And count Thy people’s triumph mine!<br/>
