<br/>
Our day of joy is here again,<br/>
With love and peace and song;<br/>
Come, let us join th’angelic strain<br/>
With voices clear and strong.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Glory to our God, we sing,<br/>
Glory to our Lord and King;<br/>
Peace, goodwill with all abide<br/>
This holy Christmas tide.<br/>
<br/>
When darkness lay upon this earth,<br/>
A glorious light did shine,<br/>
God sent a Gift of priceless worth<br/>
And showed His love divine.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Now to the manger let us go<br/>
To worship and adore<br/>
The tender Babe upon the straw,<br/>
Our Savior evermore.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How wonderful that God’s own Son<br/>
Should so Himself abase!<br/>
He thrust the mighty from their throne,<br/>
And gave the lowly grace.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
