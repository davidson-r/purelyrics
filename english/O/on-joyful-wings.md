title: On joyful wings

<center>
<br/>
On joyful wings our raptured souls<br/>
Would mount and spread their flight,<br/>
And from Mount Pisgah’s top behold<br/>
The land of pure delight.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Above the clouds, above the stars,<br/>
That heav’nly region fair,<br/>
Where He, our Lord and Savior, dwells,<br/>
Our home, our home is there.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet visions oft His love reveals,<br/>
Of that divine abode;<br/>
And with His kind, protecting hand,<br/>
He leads us on the road.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O blessèd hope that bears us up,<br/>
And stills each throb of care!<br/>
The night will pass, the morn will come,<br/>
And we shall soon be there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
