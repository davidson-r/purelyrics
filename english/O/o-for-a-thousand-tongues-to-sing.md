O for a thousand tongues to sing<br/>
My great Redeemer’s praise,<br/>
The glories of my God and King,<br/>
The triumphs of His grace!<br/>
<br/>
My gracious Master and my God,<br/>
Assist me to proclaim,<br/>
To spread through all the earth abroad<br/>
The honors of Thy name.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,<br/>
That bids our sorrows cease;<br/>
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,<br/>
’Tis life, and health, and peace.<br/>
<br/>
He breaks the power of canceled sin,<br/>
He sets the prisoner free;<br/>
His blood can make the foulest clean,<br/>
His blood availed for me.<br/>
<br/>
He speaks, and, listening to His voice,<br/>
New life the dead receive,<br/>
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,<br/>
The humble poor believe.<br/>
<br/>
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,<br/>
Your loosened tongues employ;<br/>
Ye blind, behold your Savior come,<br/>
And leap, ye lame, for joy.<br/>
<br/>
In Christ your Head, you then shall know,<br/>
Shall feel your sins forgiven;<br/>
Anticipate your heaven below,<br/>
And own that love is heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Glory to God, and praise and love<br/>
Be ever, ever given,<br/>
By saints below and saints above,<br/>
The church in earth and heaven.<br/>
<br/>
On this glad day the glorious Sun<br/>
Of Righteousness arose;<br/>
On my benighted soul He shone<br/>
And filled it with repose.<br/>
<br/>
Sudden expired the legal strife,<br/>
’Twas then I ceased to grieve;<br/>
My second, real, living life<br/>
I then began to live.<br/>
<br/>
Then with my heart I first believed,<br/>
Believed with faith divine,<br/>
Power with the Holy Ghost received<br/>
To call the Savior mine.<br/>
<br/>
I felt my Lord’s atoning blood<br/>
Close to my soul applied;<br/>
Me, me He loved, the Son of God,<br/>
For me, for me He died!<br/>
<br/>
I found and owned His promise true,<br/>
Ascertained of my part,<br/>
My pardon passed in heaven I knew<br/>
When written on my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Look unto Him, ye nations, own<br/>
Your God, ye fallen race;<br/>
Look, and be saved through faith alone,<br/>
Be justified by grace.<br/>
<br/>
See all your sins on Jesus laid:<br/>
The Lamb of God was slain,<br/>
His soul was once an offering made<br/>
For every soul of man.<br/>
<br/>
Awake from guilty nature’s sleep,<br/>
And Christ shall give you light,<br/>
Cast all your sins into the deep,<br/>
And wash the Æthiop white.<br/>
<br/>
Harlots and publicans and thieves<br/>
In holy triumph join!<br/>
Saved is the sinner that believes<br/>
From crimes as great as mine.<br/>
<br/>
Murderers and all ye hellish crew<br/>
In holy triumph join!<br/>
Believe the Savior died for you;<br/>
For me the Savior died.<br/>
<br/>
With me, your chief, ye then shall know,<br/>
Shall feel your sins forgiven;<br/>
Anticipate your heaven below,<br/>
And own that love is heaven.
