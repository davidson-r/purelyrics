O Son of God, we wait for Thee,<br/>
In love for Thine appearing;<br/>
We know Thou sittest on the throne,<br/>
And we Thy Name are bearing,<br/>
Who trusts in Thee, may joyful be,<br/>
And see Thee, Lord, descending,<br/>
To bring us bliss unending.<br/>
<br/>
We wait for Thee ’mid toil and pain,<br/>
In weariness and sighing;<br/>
But glad that Thou our guilt hast borne,<br/>
And canceled it by dying;<br/>
Hence cheerfully may we with Thee<br/>
Take up our cross and bear it,<br/>
Till we relief inherit.<br/>
<br/>
We wait for Thee; here Thou hast won<br/>
Our hearts to hope and duty;<br/>
But while our spirits feel Thee near,<br/>
Our eyes would see Thy beauty;<br/>
We fain would be at rest with Thee<br/>
In peace and joy supernal,<br/>
In glorious life eternal.<br/>
<br/>
We wait for Thee; sure Thou wilt come;<br/>
The time is swiftly nearing;<br/>
In this we also now rejoice,<br/>
And long for Thine appearing.<br/>
Oh, bliss ’twill be when Thee we see,<br/>
Homeward Thy people bringing,<br/>
With transport and with singing!
