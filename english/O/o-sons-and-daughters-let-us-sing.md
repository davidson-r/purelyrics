O sons and daughters, let us sing!<br/>
The King of heaven, the glorious King,<br/>
Over death today rose triumphing.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
That Easter morn, at break of day,<br/>
The faithful women went their way<br/>
To seek the tomb where Jesus lay.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
An angel clad in white they see,<br/>
Who sat, and spake unto the three,<br/>
“Your Lord doth go to Galilee.”<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
That night th’apostles met in fear;<br/>
Amidst them came their Lord most dear,<br/>
And said, “My peace be on all here.”<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
When Thomas first the tidings heard,<br/>
How they had seen the risen Lord,<br/>
He doubted the disciples’ word.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
“My piercèd side, O Thomas, see;<br/>
My hands, My feet, I show to thee;<br/>
Not faithless but believing be.”<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
No longer Thomas then denied;<br/>
He saw the feet, the hands, the side;<br/>
“Thou art my Lord and God,” he cried.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
How blessed are they who have not seen,<br/>
And yet whose faith has constant been;<br/>
For they eternal life shall win.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
<br/>
On this most holy day of days<br/>
Our hearts and voices, Lord, we raise<br/>
To Thee, in jubilee and praise.<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!
