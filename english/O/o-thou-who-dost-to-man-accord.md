<br/>
O Thou Who dost to man accord<br/>
His highest prize, his best reward,<br/>
Thou Hope of all our race;<br/>
Jesu, to Thee we now draw near,<br/>
Our earnest supplications hear,<br/>
Who humbly seek Thy face.<br/>
<br/>
With self accusing voice within,<br/>
Our conscience tells of many a sin<br/>
In thought, and word, and deed:<br/>
O cleanse that conscience from all stain,<br/>
The penitent restore again,<br/>
From every burthen freed.<br/>
<br/>
If Thou reject us, who shall give<br/>
Our fainting spirits strength to live?<br/>
’Tis Thine alone to spare;<br/>
With cleansèd hearts to pray aright,<br/>
And find acceptance in Thy sight,<br/>
Be this our lowly prayer.<br/>
<br/>
’This Thou has blest this solemn fast;<br/>
So may its days by us be passed<br/>
In self control severe,<br/>
That, when our Easter morn we hail<br/>
Its mystic feast we may not fail<br/>
To keep with conscience clear.<br/>
<br/>
O blessèd Trinity, bestow<br/>
Thy pardoning grace on us below,<br/>
And shield us evermore;<br/>
Until, within Thy courts above,<br/>
We see Thy face, and sing Thy love,<br/>
And with Thy saints adore.<br/>
