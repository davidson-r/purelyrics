title: O Kind Creator Bow Thine Ear

<br/>
O kind Creator, bend Thine ear<br/>
To mark the cry, to know the tear<br/>
Before Thy throne of mercy spent<br/>
In this Thy holy fast of Lent.<br/>
<br/>
Our hearts are open, Lord, to Thee;<br/>
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br/>
Pour out on all who seek Thy face<br/>
Abundance of Thy pardoning grace.<br/>
<br/>
Our sins are many, this we know;<br/>
Spare us, good Lord, Thy mercy show;<br/>
And for the honor of Thy Name<br/>
Our fainting souls to life reclaim.<br/>
<br/>
Give us the self control that springs<br/>
From discipline of outward things,<br/>
That fasting inward secretly<br/>
The soul may purely dwell with Thee.<br/>
<br/>
We pray Thee, Holy Trinity,<br/>
One God, unchanging Unity,<br/>
That we from this our abstinence<br/>
May reap the fruits of penitence.<br/>
