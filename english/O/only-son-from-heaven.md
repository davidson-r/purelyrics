<br/>
The only Son from Heaven,<br/>
Foretold by ancient seers,<br/>
By God, the Father, given,<br/>
In human shape appears;<br/>
No sphere His light confining,<br/>
No star so brightly shining<br/>
As He, our Morning Star.<br/>
<br/>
O time of God appointed,<br/>
O bright and holy morn!<br/>
He comes, the King anointed,<br/>
The Christ, the Virgin born;<br/>
His home on earth He maketh,<br/>
And man of Heaven partaketh,<br/>
Of life again an heir.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, our hearts awaken<br/>
To know and love Thee more,<br/>
In faith to stand unshaken,<br/>
In spirit to adore,<br/>
That we still heavenward hasting,<br/>
Yet here Thy joy foretasting,<br/>
May reap its fullness there.<br/>
