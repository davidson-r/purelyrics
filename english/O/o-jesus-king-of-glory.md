O Jesus, King of Glory,<br/>
Both David’s Lord and Son!<br/>
Thy realm endures forever,<br/>
In Heav’n is fixed Thy throne.<br/>
Help that in earth’s dominions,<br/>
Throughout from pole to pole,<br/>
Thy reign may spread salvation,<br/>
To each benighted soul.<br/>
<br/>
The Eastern sages, bringing<br/>
Their tribute gifts to Thee,<br/>
Bear witness to Thy kingdom<br/>
And humbly bow the knee.<br/>
To Thee the star is pointing,<br/>
And the prophetic Word;<br/>
Hence joyously we hail Thee:<br/>
Our Savior and our Lord!<br/>
<br/>
Thou art a mighty Monarch,<br/>
As by Thy Word is told,<br/>
Yet carest Thou but little<br/>
For earthly goods or gold;<br/>
On no proud steed Thou ridest,<br/>
Thou wear’st no jeweled crown<br/>
Nor dwell’st in lordly castle,<br/>
But bearest scoff and frown.<br/>
<br/>
Yet art Thou decked with beauty,<br/>
With rays of glorious light;<br/>
Thy works proclaim Thy goodness,<br/>
And all Thy ways are right.<br/>
Vouchsafe to shield Thy people<br/>
With Thine almighty arm<br/>
That they may dwell in safety<br/>
From those who mean them harm.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, look on me with pity<br/>
Though I am weak and poor;<br/>
Admit me to Thy kingdom<br/>
To dwell there, blest and sure.<br/>
I pray Thee, guide and keep me<br/>
Safe from my bitter foes,<br/>
From sin and death and Satan;<br/>
Free me from all my woes.<br/>
<br/>
And bid Thy Word within me<br/>
Shine as the fairest star;<br/>
Keep sin and all false doctrine<br/>
Forever from me far.<br/>
Help me confess Thee truly<br/>
And with Thy Christendom<br/>
Here own Thee King and Savior<br/>
And in the world to come.
