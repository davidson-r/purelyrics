title: O Happy Is The Man

<br/>
O happy is the man who hears<br/>
Instruction’s warning voice;<br/>
And who celestial Wisdom makes<br/>
His early, only choice.<br/>
<br/>
For she has treasures greater far<br/>
Than east or west unfold;<br/>
And her rewards more precious are<br/>
Than all their stores of gold.<br/>
<br/>
In her right hand she holds to view<br/>
A length of happy days;<br/>
Riches with splendid honors joined<br/>
Are what her left displays.<br/>
<br/>
She guides the young with innocence,<br/>
In pleasure’s paths to tread,<br/>
A crown of glory she bestows<br/>
Upon the hoary head.<br/>
<br/>
According as her labors rise,<br/>
So her rewards increase;<br/>
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,<br/>
And all her paths are peace.<br/>
