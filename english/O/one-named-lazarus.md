title: One Named Lazarus

One named Lazarus was sick; his two sisters feared he’d die.<br/>
So to Jesus they sent word, hoping He would soon come nigh.<br/>
But when He received their word, two more days He did abide.<br/>
He said, “This won’t end in death; rather, I’ll be glorified.<br/>
This is for God’s glory great; through it I’ll be glorified.”<br/>
<br/>
Now when Jesus finally came, Laz’rus had been dead four days.<br/>
Martha went to welcome Him, asking why He’d stayed away.<br/>
She said, “Lord, if You’d been here, my dear brother still would live.<br/>
But I know that even now, all you ask, God will now give.<br/>
Though he’s dead, yet still I know, all You ask, God will now give.”<br/>
<br/>
“Resurrection and the life—I am both,” Jesus did say.<br/>
“He who does believe in Me, he will live beyond the grave.<br/>
He who lives, believes in Me, he will ne’er to death succumb.”<br/>
Martha said, “You are the Christ; You’re the One who was to come.<br/>
You’re the Christ, the Son of God; You’re the One Who was to come.”<br/>
<br/>
Martha then her sister called; Mary went to meet the Lord.<br/>
When she reached Him, knelt in tears, seeking comfort from His word.<br/>
Jesus, deeply moved, did ask, “Where have you his body laid?”<br/>
And He wept when He did see, for His love was very great.<br/>
Jesus wept and shared their grief, for His love was very great.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus then approached the tomb. “Take away the stone,” He said.<br/>
“But,” said Martha, “there’s a stench, for four days he has been dead.”<br/>
Jesus said, “You now will see God’s great glory—just believe.”<br/>
So they took away the stone, and he prayed, “May they believe;<br/>
Father, thank You, You have heard; may they now in Me believe.”<br/>
<br/>
Jesus then did give command; in a loud voice He did say,<br/>
“Laz’rus, come out of the tomb!” And the dead man did obey.<br/>
Both his hands and feet were bound, and a cloth did hide his face.<br/>
“Take the grave clothes; let him go,” Jesus said to those amazed.<br/>
“Said I not, believe and see God’s great glory in this place?”<br/>
<br/>
Just as Jesus gave new life to a man when he was dead,<br/>
He can do the same for all who believe what He has said.<br/>
For we all in sin are dead; resurrection life we need.<br/>
Jesus died and rose again, that we might from sin be freed.<br/>
All who put their trust in Him will not die but live indeed.
