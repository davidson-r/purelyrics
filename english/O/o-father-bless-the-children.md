title: O Father Bless The Children

O Father, bless the children<br/>
Brought hither to Thy gate;<br/>
Lift up their fallen nature,<br/>
Restore their lost estate;<br/>
Renew Thine image in them,<br/>
And own them, by this sign,<br/>
The very sons and daughters<br/>
New born of birth divine.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesu, Lord, receive them;<br/>
Thy loving arms of old<br/>
Were opened wide to welcome<br/>
The children to Thy fold;<br/>
Let these, baptized, and dying,<br/>
Then rising from the dead,<br/>
Henceforth be living members<br/>
Of Thee, their living Head.<br/>
<br/>
O Holy, Spirit, keep them;<br/>
Dwell with them to the last,<br/>
Till all the fight is ended,<br/>
And all the storms are past.<br/>
Renew the gift baptismal,<br/>
From strength to strength, till each<br/>
The troublous waves oâ€™ercoming,<br/>
The land of life shall reach.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, Son, and Spirit,<br/>
O Wisdom, Love, and Power,<br/>
We wait the promised blessing<br/>
In this accepted hour!<br/>
We name upon the children<br/>
The threefold Name divine;<br/>
Receive them, cleanse them, own them,<br/>
And keep them ever Thine.
