<br/>
O help us, Lord, each hour of need<br/>
Thy heavenly succor give;<br/>
Help us in thought, and word, and deed,<br/>
Each hour on earth we live.<br/>
<br/>
O help us, when our spirits bleed<br/>
With contrite anguish sore;<br/>
And when our hearts are cold and dead,<br/>
O help us, Lord, the more.<br/>
<br/>
O help us through the prayer of faith<br/>
More firmly to believe;<br/>
For still the more the servant hath,<br/>
The more shall he receive.<br/>
<br/>
O help us, Jesu, from on high,<br/>
We know no help but Thee;<br/>
O help us to so to live and die,<br/>
As Thine in Heavâ€™n to be.<br/>
