title: One Sweetly Solemn Thought

<center>
<br/>
One sweetly solemn thought<br/>
Comes to me o’er and o’er;<br/>
Nearer to my home today am I<br/>
Than e’er I’ve been before.<br/>
<br/>
Nearer my Father’s house,<br/>
Where many mansions be;<br/>
Nearer today, the great white throne,<br/>
Nearer the crystal sea.<br/>
<br/>
Nearer the bound of life<br/>
Where burdens are laid down;<br/>
Nearer to leave the heavy cross,<br/>
Nearer to gain the crown.<br/>
<br/>
But lying darkly between,<br/>
Winding down through the night,<br/>
Is the deep and unknown stream<br/>
To be crossed ere we reach the light.<br/>
<br/>
Father, perfect my trust!<br/>
Strengthen my power of faith!<br/>
Nor let me stand, at last, alone<br/>
Upon the shore of death.<br/>
<br/>
Be Thee near when my feet<br/>
Are slipping over the brink;<br/>
For it may be I’m nearer home,<br/>
Nearer now than I think.<br/>
