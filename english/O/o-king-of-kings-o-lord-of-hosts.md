O King of kings, O Lord of hosts, Whose throne is lifted high<br/>
Above the nations of the earth, the armies of the sky,<br/>
The spirits of perfected saints may give their nobler songs<br/>
And we, Thy children, worship Thee, to Whom all praise belongs.<br/>
<br/>
Thy hand has hid within our fields treasures of countless worth;<br/>
The light, the suns of other years, shine from the depths of earth;<br/>
The very dust, inbreathed by Thee, the clods all cold and dead,<br/>
Wake into beauty and to life, to give Thy children bread.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Who hast sown the sky with stars, and set Thy thoughts in gold,<br/>
Hast crowned our nation’s life, and ours, with blessings manifold;<br/>
Thy mercies have been numberless; Thy love, Thy grace, Thy care,<br/>
Were wider than our utmost need, and higher than our prayer.<br/>
<br/>
O King of kings, O Lord of hosts, our fathers’ God and ours!<br/>
Be with us in the future years; and if the tempest lowers,<br/>
Look through the cloud with light of love, and smile our tears away<br/>
And lead us through the brightening years to Heaven’s eternal day.
