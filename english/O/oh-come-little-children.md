<br/>
Oh, come, little children, oh, come, one and all,<br/>
To Bethlehem’s stable, in Bethlehem’s stall.<br/>
And see with rejoicing this glorious sight,<br/>
Our Father in heaven has sent us this night.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, see in the manger, in hallowèd light<br/>
A star throws its beam on this holiest sight.<br/>
In clean swaddling clothes lies the heavenly Child,<br/>
More lovely than angels, this Baby so mild.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there lies the Christ Child, on hay and on straw;<br/>
The shepherds are kneeling before Him with awe.<br/>
And Mary and Joseph smile on Him with love,<br/>
While angels are singing sweet songs from above.<br/>
