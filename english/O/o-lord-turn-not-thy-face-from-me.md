title: O Lord Turn Not Thy Face From Me

<br/>
O Lord, turn not Thy face from me,<br/>
Who lie in woeful state,<br/>
Lamenting all my sinful life<br/>
Before Thy mercy-gate.<br/>
<br/>
A gate which opens wide to those<br/>
That do lament their sin;<br/>
Shut not that gate against me, Lord,<br/>
But let me enter in.<br/>
<br/>
And call me not to strict account<br/>
How I have sojourned here;<br/>
For then my guilty conscience knows<br/>
How vile I shall appear.<br/>
<br/>
So come I to Thy mercy gate,<br/>
Where mercy doth abound,<br/>
Requiring mercy for my sin<br/>
To heal my deadly wound.<br/>
<br/>
Mercy, good Lord, mercy I ask;<br/>
This is my humble prayer;<br/>
For mercy, Lord is all my suit,<br/>
O let Thy mercy spare.<br/>
