<br/>
On Judah’s plains as shepherds sat,<br/>
Watching their flocks by night,<br/>
The angel of the Lord appeared,<br/>
Clad in celestial light.<br/>
<br/>
Awe struck the vision they regard,<br/>
Appalled with trembling fear;<br/>
When thus a cherub voice divine<br/>
Breathed sweetly on their ear.<br/>
<br/>
“Shepherds of Judah! cease your fears,<br/>
And calm your troubled mind;<br/>
Glad tidings of great joy I bring<br/>
To you and all mankind.<br/>
<br/>
“This day almighty Love fulfills<br/>
Its great eternal Word;<br/>
This day is born in Bethlehem<br/>
A Savior, Christ the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
“There shall you find the heavenly Babe<br/>
In humblest weeds arrayed;<br/>
All meanly wrapped in swaddling clothes<br/>
And in a manger laid.”<br/>
<br/>
He ceased, and sudden all around<br/>
Appeared a radiant throng<br/>
Of angels, praising God, and thus<br/>
Warbling their choral song.<br/>
<br/>
“Glory to God, from Whom on high<br/>
All gracious mercies flow!<br/>
Who sends His Heav’n descended Peace<br/>
To dwell with man below.”<br/>
