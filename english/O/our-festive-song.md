title: Our Festive Song

<center>
We welcome with delight<br/>
Another happy day,<br/>
Our hearts like merry bells<br/>
Ring out the silver lay;<br/>
We catch the rosy beams<br/>
Reflected from the eye<br/>
Of Him Whose wonders fill the earth,<br/>
Whose glory fills the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Another year has gone,<br/>
Another year begun;<br/>
To our Redeemer glory be<br/>
For all His love for me.<br/>
We thank His holy Name<br/>
For all His tender care,<br/>
We praise Him for the Sunday School,<br/>
And faithful teachers there.<br/>
<br/>
Cold winter flies away,<br/>
The blushing, fairy spring<br/>
Comes tripping o’er the lees,<br/>
While birds are on the wing;<br/>
And now, a merry throng,<br/>
We come as glad as they;<br/>
Our banners waving in the air,<br/>
We hail our festive day.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The straight and narrow path<br/>
O may we early find,<br/>
And try to serve the Lord<br/>
With heart, and soul, and mind;<br/>
O what a happy day,<br/>
And one that ne’er shall end,<br/>
In that bright world where angels sing,<br/>
We all with Him may spend!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
