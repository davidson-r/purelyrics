On Christmas night all Christians sing,<br/>
To hear the news the angels bring;<br/>
On Christmas night all Christians sing,<br/>
To hear the news the angels bring:<br/>
News of great joy, news of great mirth,<br/>
News of our merciful King’s birth.<br/>
<br/>
Then why should men on earth be sad,<br/>
Since our Redeemer made us glad:<br/>
Then why should we on earth be sad,<br/>
Since our Redeemer made us glad:<br/>
When from our sin He set us free,<br/>
All for to gain our liberty.<br/>
<br/>
When sin departs before Your grace,<br/>
Then life and health come in its place;<br/>
When sin departs before Your grace,<br/>
Then life and health come in its place;<br/>
Angels and men with joy may sing,<br/>
All for to see the newborn King.<br/>
<br/>
All out of darkness we have light<br/>
Which made the angels sing this night;<br/>
All out of darkness we have light<br/>
Which made the angels sing this night:<br/>
“Glory to God and peace to men,<br/>
Now and forevermore. Amen.”<br/>
