<br/>
O come, O come, Emmanuel<br/>
And ransom captive Israel<br/>
That mourns in lonely exile here<br/>
Until the Son of God appear<br/>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br/>
Shall come to thee, O Israel.<br/>
<br/>
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free<br/>
Thine own from Satan's tyranny<br/>
From depths of Hell Thy people save<br/>
And give them victory o'er the grave<br/>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br/>
Shall come to thee, O Israel.<br/>
<br/>
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer<br/>
Our spirits by Thine advent here<br/>
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night<br/>
And death's dark shadows put to flight.<br/>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br/>
Shall come to thee, O Israel.<br/>
<br/>
O come, Thou Key of David, come,<br/>
And open wide our heavenly home;<br/>
Make safe the way that leads on high,<br/>
And close the path to misery.<br/>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br/>
Shall come to thee, O Israel.<br/>
<br/>
O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,<br/>
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,<br/>
In ancient times did'st give the Law,<br/>
In cloud, and majesty and awe.<br/>
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel<br/>
Shall come to thee, O Israel. <br/>
