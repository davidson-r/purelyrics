<br/>
O Savior, Who for man hast trod<br/>
The winepress of the wrath of God,<br/>
Ascend, and claim again on high<br/>
Thy glory left for us to die.<br/>
<br/>
A radiant cloud is now Thy seat,<br/>
And earth lies stretched beneath Thy feet;<br/>
Ten thousand thousands round Thee sing,<br/>
And share the triumph of their King.<br/>
<br/>
The angel host enraptured waits:<br/>
“Lift up your heads, eternal gates!”<br/>
O God-and-Man! the Father’s throne<br/>
Is now forevermore Thine own.<br/>
<br/>
Our great High Priest and Shepherd Thou<br/>
Within the veil art entered now,<br/>
To offer here Thy precious blood<br/>
Once poured on earth a cleansing flood.<br/>
<br/>
And thence the Church, Thy chosen Bride,<br/>
With countless gifts of grace supplied,<br/>
Through all her members draws from Thee<br/>
Her hidden life of sanctity.<br/>
<br/>
O Christ, our Lord, of Thy dear care,<br/>
Thy lowly members heavenward bear;<br/>
Be ours with Thee to suffer pain,<br/>
With Thee forevermore to reign.<br/>
<br/>
All praise from every heart and tongue<br/>
To Thee, ascended Lord, be sung;<br/>
All praise to God the Father be<br/>
And Holy Ghost eternally.<br/>
