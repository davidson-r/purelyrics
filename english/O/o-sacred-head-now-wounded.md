<br/>
O sacred Head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down,<br/>
Now scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown;<br/>
O sacred Head, what glory, what bliss till now was Thine!<br/>
Yet, though despised and gory, I joy to call Thee mine.<br/>
<br/>
What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered, was all for sinners’ gain;<br/>
Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain.<br/>
Lo, here I fall, my Savior! ’Tis I deserve Thy place;<br/>
Look on me with Thy favor, vouchsafe to me Thy grace.<br/>
<br/>
Men mock and taunt and jeer Thee, Thou noble countenance,<br/>
Though mighty worlds shall fear Thee and flee before Thy glance.<br/>
How art thou pale with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn!<br/>
How doth Thy visage languish that once was bright as morn!<br/>
<br/>
Now from Thy cheeks has vanished their color once so fair;<br/>
From Thy red lips is banished the splendor that was there.<br/>
Grim death, with cruel rigor, hath robbed Thee of Thy life;<br/>
Thus Thou hast lost Thy vigor, Thy strength in this sad strife.<br/>
<br/>
My burden in Thy Passion, Lord, Thou hast borne for me,<br/>
For it was my transgression which brought this woe on Thee.<br/>
I cast me down before Thee, wrath were my rightful lot;<br/>
Have mercy, I implore Thee; Redeemer, spurn me not!<br/>
<br/>
What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest friend,<br/>
For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?<br/>
O make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be,<br/>
Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
My Shepherd, now receive me; my Guardian, own me Thine.<br/>
Great blessings Thou didst give me, O source of gifts divine.<br/>
Thy lips have often fed me with words of truth and love;<br/>
Thy Spirit oft hath led me to heavenly joys above.<br/>
<br/>
Here I will stand beside Thee, from Thee I will not part;<br/>
O Savior, do not chide me! When breaks Thy loving heart,<br/>
When soul and body languish in death’s cold, cruel grasp,<br/>
Then, in Thy deepest anguish, Thee in mine arms I’ll clasp.<br/>
<br/>
The joy can never be spoken, above all joys beside,<br/>
When in Thy body broken I thus with safety hide.<br/>
O Lord of Life, desiring Thy glory now to see,<br/>
Beside Thy cross expiring, I’d breathe my soul to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
My Savior, be Thou near me when death is at my door;<br/>
Then let Thy presence cheer me, forsake me nevermore!<br/>
When soul and body languish, oh, leave me not alone,<br/>
But take away mine anguish by virtue of Thine own!<br/>
<br/>
Be Thou my consolation, my shield when I must die;<br/>
Remind me of Thy passion when my last hour draws nigh.<br/>
Mine eyes shall then behold Thee, upon Thy cross shall dwell,<br/>
My heart by faith enfolds Thee. Who dieth thus dies well. <br/>
