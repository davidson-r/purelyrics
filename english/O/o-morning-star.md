O Morning Star, how fair and bright!<br/>
Thou beamest forth in truth and light,<br/>
O Sovereign meek and lowly!<br/>
Thou Root of Jesse, Davidâ€™s Son,<br/>
My Lord and Master, Thou hast won<br/>
My heart to serve Thee solely!<br/>
Thou art holy,<br/>
Fair and glorious, all victorious, rich in blessing<br/>
Rule and might over all possessing.<br/>
<br/>
Thou heavenly Brightness! Light divine!<br/>
O deep within my heart now shine,<br/>
And make Thee there an altar!<br/>
Fill me with joy and strength to be<br/>
Thy member, ever, joined to Thee<br/>
In love that cannot falter;<br/>
Toward Thee longing<br/>
Doth possess me; turn and bless me; here in sadness<br/>
Eye and heart long for Thy gladness!
