<br/>
Lord, our Father, thanks to Thee<br/>
In this new year we render,<br/>
For every evil had to flee<br/>
Before Thee, our Defender.<br/>
Our life was nourished, we were fed<br/>
With rich supplies of daily bread,<br/>
And peace reigned in our borders.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, our thanks to Thee<br/>
In this new year we render;<br/>
Thy reign hath kept Thy people free,<br/>
Hath shown Thy mercies tender.<br/>
Thou hast redeemed us with Thy blood,<br/>
Thou art our Joy, our only Good,<br/>
In life and death our Savior.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Holy Ghost, our thanks to Thee<br/>
In this new year we render,<br/>
For Thou hast led our eyes to see<br/>
Thy truth in all its splendor<br/>
And thus enkindled from above<br/>
Within our hearts true faith and love<br/>
And other Christian virtues.<br/>
<br/>
Our faithful God, we cry to Thee:<br/>
Still bless us with Thy favor,<br/>
Blot out all our iniquity,<br/>
And hide our sins forever.<br/>
Grant us a happy, good new year<br/>
And, when the hour of death draws near,<br/>
A peaceful, blest departure.<br/>
