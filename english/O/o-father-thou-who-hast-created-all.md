<br/>
O Father, Thou Who hast created all<br/>
In wisest love, we pray,<br/>
Look on this babe, who at Thy gracious call<br/>
Is entering on life’s way;<br/>
Bend o’er him in Thy tenderness,<br/>
Thine image on his soul impress;<br/>
O Father, hear!<br/>
<br/>
O Son of God, Who diedst for us, behold,<br/>
We bring our child to Thee;<br/>
Thou tender Shepherd, take him to Thy fold,<br/>
Thine own for aye to be;<br/>
Defend him through this earthly strife,<br/>
And lead him on the path of life,<br/>
O Son of God!<br/>
<br/>
O Holy Ghost, Who broodest o’er the wave,<br/>
Descend upon this child;<br/>
Give him undying life, his spirit lave<br/>
With waters undefiled;<br/>
Grant him, while yet a babe, to be<br/>
A child of God, a home for Thee,<br/>
O Holy Ghost!<br/>
<br/>
O Triune God, what Thou command’st is done;<br/>
We speak, but Thine the might;<br/>
This child hath scarce yet seen our earthly sun,<br/>
Yet pour on him Thy light,<br/>
In faith and hope, in joy and love,<br/>
Thou Sun of all below, above,<br/>
O Triune God!<br/>
