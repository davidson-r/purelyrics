O One with God the Father,<br/>
In majesty and might,<br/>
The Brightness of His glory,<br/>
Eternal Light of Light,<br/>
O’er this our home of darkness<br/>
Thy rays are streaming now;<br/>
The shadows flee before Thee,<br/>
The world’s true Light art Thou.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, Lord, we but darkly,<br/>
O heavenly Light, arise,<br/>
Dispel these mists that shroud us,<br/>
And hide Thee from our eyes.<br/>
We long to track the footprints<br/>
That Thou Thyself hast trod;<br/>
We long to see the pathway<br/>
That leads to Thee our God.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, shine around us,<br/>
With radiance of Thy grace;<br/>
O Jesus, turn upon us<br/>
The brightness of Thy face.<br/>
We need no star to guide us,<br/>
As on our way we press,<br/>
If Thou Thy light vouchsafest,<br/>
O Sun of Righteousness.
