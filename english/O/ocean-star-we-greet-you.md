<br/>
Ocean star, we greet you;<br/>
Maid of fame immortal,<br/>
God's beloved Mother,<br/>
Heaven's joyous portal. <br/>
<br/>
Even as the angel<br/>
Used the name of Eva,<br/>
Changing it to Ave,<br/>
Greet us, make us peaceful. <br/>
<br/>
Break our chains forever;<br/>
Banish ev'ry sadness;<br/>
Be our light to guide us;<br/>
Be our ev'ry gladness. <br/>
<br/>
Be our intercessor;<br/>
Show yourself a mother:<br/>
Jesus came to save us<br/>
Through you and no other. <br/>
<br/>
Praise to God the Father,<br/>
To the Son forever,<br/>
And the Holy Spirit,<br/>
Three in One together. <br/>
