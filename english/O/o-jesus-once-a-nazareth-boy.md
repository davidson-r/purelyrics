title: O Jesus Once A Nazareth Boy

<center>
O Jesus, once a Nazareth boy,<br/>
And tempted like as we,<br/>
All inward foes help us destroy<br/>
And spotless all to be.<br/>
We trust Thee for the grace to win<br/>
The high, victorious, goal,<br/>
Where purity shall conquer sin<br/>
In Christlike self control.<br/>
<br/>
O Jesus, Prince of life and truth,<br/>
Beneath Thy banner bright,<br/>
We dedicate our strength and youth<br/>
To battle for the right;<br/>
We give our lives with glad intent<br/>
To serve the world and Thee,<br/>
To die, to suffer and be spent<br/>
To set our brothers free.<br/>
<br/>
In serried ranks, we fearless tread,<br/>
O Captain of us all,<br/>
Thy glory on our banners shed,<br/>
We answer to Thy call;<br/>
And where the fiercest battles press<br/>
Against the hosts of sin,<br/>
To rescue those in dire distress<br/>
We gladly enter in.
