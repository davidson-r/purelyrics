<br/>
O blessèd home where those who meet<br/>
Shall never say goodbye;<br/>
Where kindred souls each other greet,<br/>
And never say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye;<br/>
In that fair land beyond the sky,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this vale of toil and care,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye;<br/>
We part in tears on earth, but there—<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When safe among the ransomed throng<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye;<br/>
Where life is one eternal song,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
On yonder fair and peaceful shore,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye;<br/>
But dwell with Christ forevermore,<br/>
And never say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
