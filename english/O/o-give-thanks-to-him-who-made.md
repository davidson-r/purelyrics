<br/>
O give thanks to Him Who made<br/>
Morning light and evening shade;<br/>
Source and Giver of all good,<br/>
Nightly sleep and daily food;<br/>
Quickener of our wearied powers,<br/>
Guard of our unconscious hours.<br/>
<br/>
O give thanks to nature’s King,<br/>
Who made every breathing thing;<br/>
His, our warm and sentient frame,<br/>
His, the mind’s immortal flame.<br/>
O how close the ties that bind<br/>
Spirits to the Eternal Mind!<br/>
<br/>
O give thanks with heart and lip,<br/>
For we are His workmanship;<br/>
And all creatures are His care:<br/>
Not a bird that cleaves the air<br/>
Falls unnoticed; but who can<br/>
Speak the Father’s love to man?<br/>
<br/>
O give thanks to Him Who came<br/>
In a mortal, suffering frame<br/>
Temple of the Deity<br/>
Came for rebel man to die;<br/>
In the path Himself hath trod<br/>
Leading back His saints to God.<br/>
