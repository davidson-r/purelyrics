title: One Sole Baptismal Sign

<center>
One sole baptismal sign,<br/>
One Lord below, above,<br/>
Zion, one faith is thine,<br/>
One only watchword - love;<br/>
From different temples though it rise,<br/>
One song ascendeth to the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Our Sacrifice is one,<br/>
One Priest before the throne,<br/>
The slain, the risen Son,<br/>
Redeemer, Lord alone;<br/>
And sighs from contrite hearts that spring<br/>
Our chief, our choicest offering.<br/>
<br/>
O may that holy prayer,<br/>
His tenderest, and His last,<br/>
His constant, latest care,<br/>
Ere to His throne He passed,<br/>
No longer unfulfilled remain,<br/>
The world’s offense, His people’s stain.<br/>
<br/>
Head of Thy Church beneath,<br/>
The catholic, the true,<br/>
On all her members breathe<br/>
Her broken frame renew;<br/>
Then shall Thy perfect will be done,<br/>
When Christians love and live as one.
