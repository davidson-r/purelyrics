<br/>
O Father all creating,<br/>
Whose wisdom, love and power<br/>
First bound two lives together<br/>
In Eden's primal hour,<br/>
To-day, to these thy children<br/>
Thine earliest gifts renew<br/>
A home by thee made happy,<br/>
A love by thee kept true.<br/>
<br/>
O Saviour, guest most bounteous<br/>
Of old in Galilee,<br/>
Vouchsafe to-day thy presence<br/>
With these who call on thee;<br/>
Their store of earthly gladness<br/>
Transform to heavenly wine,<br/>
And teach them, in the tasting,<br/>
To know the gift is thine.<br/>
<br/>
O Spirit of the Father,<br/>
Breathe on them from above,<br/>
So mighty in thy pureness,<br/>
So tender in thy love;<br/>
That guarded by thy presence,<br/>
From sin and strife kept free,<br/>
Their lives may own thy guidance,<br/>
Their hearts be ruled by thee.<br/>
<br/>
Except thou build it, Father,<br/>
The house is built in vain;<br/>
Except thou, Saviour, bless it,<br/>
The joy will turn to pain;<br/>
But nought can break the marriage<br/>
Of hearts in thee made one,<br/>
And love thy spirit hallows<br/>
Is endless love begun.<br/>
