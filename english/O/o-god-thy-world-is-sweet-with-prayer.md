<br/>
O God, Thy world is sweet with prayer;<br/>
The breath of Christ is in the air;<br/>
We rise on Thy free Spiritâ€™s wings,<br/>
And every thought within us sings.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art our Morning and our Sun,<br/>
Our work is glad, in Thee begun;<br/>
Our foot worn path is fresh with dew,<br/>
For Thou createst all things new.<br/>
<br/>
O God, within us and above,<br/>
Close to us in the Christ we love,<br/>
Through Him, our only Guide and Way,<br/>
May heavenly life be ours today!<br/>
