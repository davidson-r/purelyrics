<br/>
O Love divine and golden,<br/>
Mysterious depth and height,<br/>
To Thee the world beholden,<br/>
Looks up for life and light;<br/>
O Love divine and gentle,<br/>
The blesser and the blest,<br/>
Beneath Thy care parental<br/>
The world lies down in rest.<br/>
<br/>
O Love divine and tender,<br/>
That through our homes dost move,<br/>
Veiled in the softened splendor<br/>
O holy household love,<br/>
A throne without Thy blessing<br/>
Were labor without rest,<br/>
And cottages possessing<br/>
Thy blessedness are blest.<br/>
<br/>
God bless these hands united;<br/>
God bless these hearts made one!<br/>
Unsevered and unblighted<br/>
May they through life go on,<br/>
Here in earth’s home preparing<br/>
For the bright home above,<br/>
And there forever sharing<br/>
Its joy where “God is Love.”<br/>
