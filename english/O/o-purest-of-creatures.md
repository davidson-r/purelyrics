title: O purest of creatures

<br/>
O purest of creatures, sweet Mother, sweet Maid,<br/>
The one spotless womb wherein Jesus was laid,<br/>
All lost in the darkness we call upon thee,<br/>
And look to thy shining, bright Star of the Sea. <br/>
<br/>
O fairest of virgins, sweet Mother, sweet Maid,<br/>
The God in His goodness with beauty arrayed.<br/>
He lovingly chose thee His mother to be;<br/>
He shone in thy shining, bright Star of the Sea. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, may thy pure light on our souls ever shine;<br/>
And keep them unsullied and sinless as thine,<br/>
Till after this exile united we be,<br/>
Through ages unending, in glory with thee. <br/>
