O Jesus Christ, Thy manger is<br/>
My paradise at which my soul reclineth.<br/>
For there, O Lord, doth lie the Word<br/>
Made flesh for us; herein Thy grace forthshineth.<br/>
<br/>
He Whom the sea and wind obey<br/>
Doth come to serve the sinner in great meekness.<br/>
Thou, God’s own Son, with us art one,<br/>
Dost join us and our children in our weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Thy light and grace our guilt efface,<br/>
Thy heavenly riches all our loss retrieving.<br/>
Immanuel, Thy birth doth quell<br/>
The power of hell and Satan’s bold deceiving.<br/>
<br/>
Thou Christian heart, whoe’er thou art,<br/>
Be of good cheer and let no sorrow move thee!<br/>
For God’s own Child, in mercy mild,<br/>
Joins thee to Him how greatly God must love thee!<br/>
<br/>
Remember thou what glory now<br/>
The Lord prepared thee for all earthly sadness.<br/>
The angel host can never boast<br/>
Of greater glory, greater bliss or gladness.<br/>
<br/>
The world may hold her wealth and gold;<br/>
But thou, my heart, keep Christ as thy true Treasure.<br/>
To Him hold fast until at last<br/>
A crown be thine and honor in full measure.
