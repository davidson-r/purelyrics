<br/>
Remember, O thou man, <br/>
O thou man, O thou man,<br/>
Remember O thou man, <br/>
Thy time is spent.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, O thou man, <br/>
How thou cams't to me then, <br/>
And I did what I can, <br/>
Therefore repent.<br/>
<br/>
Remember Adam's fall,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
Remember Adam's fall<br/>
From heaven to hell!<br/>
<br/>
Remember Adam's fall,<br/>
How we were condemned all<br/>
To hell perpetual,<br/>
There for to dwell.<br/>
<br/>
Remember God's goodness,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
Remember God's goodness,<br/>
And promise made!<br/>
<br/>
Remember God's goodness,<br/>
How His only Son He sent<br/>
Our sins for to redress,<br/>
Be not afraid.<br/>
<br/>
The angels all did sing,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
The angels all did sing,<br/>
On Sion hill<br/>
<br/>
The angels all did sing,<br/>
Praises to our glorious King,<br/>
And peace to man living,<br/>
With a good will!'<br/>
<br/>
The Shepherds amazed was,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
The Shepherds amazed was,<br/>
To hear the angels sing.<br/>
<br/>
The Shepherds amazed was<br/>
How it should come to pass<br/>
That Christ our Messias<br/>
Should be our King!<br/>
<br/>
To Bethlehem did they go,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
The shepherds three;<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
<br/>
To Bethlehem did they go,<br/>
To see whether it were so,<br/>
Whether Christ were borne or no<br/>
To set man free. <br/>
<br/>
As the Angels before did say,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
As the Angels before did say,<br/>
So it came to pass;<br/>
<br/>
As the Angels before did say,<br/>
They found him wrapt in hay<br/>
In a manger, where he lay<br/>
So poor he was.<br/>
<br/>
In Bethlehem he was born,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
In Bethlehem he was born,<br/>
For mankind's sake;<br/>
<br/>
In Bethlehem he was born,<br/>
For us that were forlorn,<br/>
And therefore took no scorn<br/>
Our sins to bear.<br/>
<br/>
In a manger laid he was,<br/>
O thou Man, O thou Man,<br/>
In a manger laid he was<br/>
At this time present.<br/>
<br/>
In a manger laid he was,<br/>
Between an ox and an ass,<br/>
And all for our trespass,<br/>
Therefore repent.<br/>
<br/>
Give thanks to God always,<br/>
O thou man, O thou man!<br/>
Give thanks to God always,<br/>
With heart most joyfully<br/>
<br/>
Give thanks to God always,<br/>
Upon this blessed day,<br/>
Let all men sing and say:<br/>
'Holy, holy!'<br/>
