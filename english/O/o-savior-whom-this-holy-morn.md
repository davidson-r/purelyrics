<br/>
O Savior, Whom this holy morn<br/>
Gave to our world below;<br/>
To mortal want and labor born,<br/>
And more than mortal woe.<br/>
<br/>
Incarnate Word! by every grief,<br/>
By each temptation tried,<br/>
Who lived to yield our ills relief,<br/>
And to redeem us died!<br/>
<br/>
If gaily clothed and proudly fed<br/>
In dangerous wealth we dwell,<br/>
Remind us of Thy manger bed<br/>
And lowly cottage cell.<br/>
<br/>
If pressed by poverty severe<br/>
In anxious want we pine,<br/>
O may Thy Spirit whisper near<br/>
How poor a lot was Thine!<br/>
<br/>
Through this lifeâ€™s ever varying scene<br/>
From sin preserve us free;<br/>
Like us Thou hast a mourner been,<br/>
May we rejoice with Thee!<br/>
