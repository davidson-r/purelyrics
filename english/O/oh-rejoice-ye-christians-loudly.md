<center>
Oh, rejoice, ye Christians, loudly,<br/>
For our joy hath now begun;<br/>
Wondrous things our God hath done.<br/>
Tell abroad His goodness proudly<br/>
Who our race hath honored thus<br/>
That He deigns to dwell with us.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Joy, O joy, beyond all gladness,<br/>
Christ hath done away with sadness!<br/>
Hence, all sorrow and repining,<br/>
For the Sun of Grace is shining!<br/>
<br/>
See, my soul, thy Savior chooses<br/>
Weakness here and poverty;<br/>
In such love He comes to thee<br/>
Nor the hardest couch refuses;<br/>
All He suffers for thy good,<br/>
To redeem thee by His blood.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lord, how shall I thank Thee rightly?<br/>
I acknowledge that by Thee<br/>
I am saved eternally.<br/>
Let me not forget it lightly<br/>
But to Thee at all times cleave<br/>
And my heart true peace receive.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, guard and guide Thy members,<br/>
Fill Thy brethren with Thy grace,<br/>
Hear their prayers in every place.<br/>
Quicken now lifeâ€™s faintest embers,<br/>
Grant all Christians, far and near,<br/>
Holy peace, a glad new Year!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
