<br/>
O heart of Mary, pure and fair,<br/>
And free from sin's domain,<br/>
In Adam's fall you had no share,<br/>
In you there is no stain. <br/>
<br/>
As some fair lily grown in thorns,<br/>
Your heart so full of grace<br/>
With spotless purity adorns<br/>
Our sinful fallen race. <br/>
<br/>
The Heart of Christ, by God's decree,<br/>
Was formed beneath your heart;<br/>
We long to love you just as He,<br/>
In your love give us part. <br/>
<br/>
You kept His words within your heart<br/>
And gave them veneration;<br/>
Give us the grace which they impart;<br/>
Give us their consolation. <br/>
