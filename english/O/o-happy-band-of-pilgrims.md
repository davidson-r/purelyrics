<br/>
O happy band of pilgrims,<br/>
If onward you will tread,<br/>
With Jesus as your Fellow,<br/>
To Jesus as your Head.<br/>
<br/>
O happy if you labor,<br/>
As Jesus did for men;<br/>
O happy if you hunger<br/>
As Jesus hungered then.<br/>
<br/>
The cross that Jesus carried<br/>
He carried as your due;<br/>
The crown that Jesus weareth<br/>
He weareth it for you.<br/>
<br/>
The faith by which you see Him,<br/>
The hope in which you yearn,<br/>
The love that through all troubles<br/>
To Him alone will turn.<br/>
<br/>
The trials that beset you,<br/>
The sorrows you endure,<br/>
The manifold temptations<br/>
That death alone can cure.<br/>
<br/>
What are they but His jewels<br/>
Of right celestial worth?<br/>
What are they but the ladder<br/>
Set up to heaven on earth?<br/>
<br/>
O happy band of pilgrims,<br/>
Look upward to the skies,<br/>
Where such a light affliction<br/>
Shall win you such a prize.<br/>
<br/>
To Father, Son, and Spirit,<br/>
The God Whom we adore,<br/>
Be loftiest praises given,<br/>
Now and for evermore.<br/>
