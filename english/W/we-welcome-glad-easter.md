title: We Welcome Glad Easter

<br/>
We welcome glad Easter when Jesus arose,<br/>
And won a great victory over His foes.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Then raise your glad voices, all Christians and sing,<br/>
Bring glad Easter tidings to Jesus, your King.<br/>
<br/>
We tell how the women came early that day,<br/>
And there at the tomb found the stone rolled away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We sing of the angel who said: “Do not fear!<br/>
Your Savior is risen, and He is not here.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We think of the promise which Jesus did give:<br/>
“That he who believes in Me also shall live!”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
