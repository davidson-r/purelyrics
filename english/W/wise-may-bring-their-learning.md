title: Wise May Bring Their Learning
---

---
<center>
The wise may bring their learning, the rich may bring their wealth,<br/>
And some may bring their greatness, and some bring strength and health;<br/>
We, too, would bring our treasures to offer to the King;<br/>
We have no wealth or learning; what shall we children bring?<br/>
<br/>
We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him; we’ll bring Him thankful praise,<br/>
And young souls meekly striving to walk in holy ways;<br/>
And these shall be the treasures we offer to the King,<br/>
And these are gifts that even the poorest child may bring.<br/>
<br/>
We’ll bring the little duties we have to do each day;<br/>
We’ll try our best to please Him, at home, at school, at play;<br/>
And better are these treasures to offer to our King;<br/>
Than richest gifts without them yet these a child may bring.
