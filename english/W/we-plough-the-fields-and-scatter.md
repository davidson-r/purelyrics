title: We Plough The Fields And Scatter

<br/>
We plough the fields and scatter<br/>
The good seed on the land,<br/>
But it is fed and watered<br/>
By God's almighty hand:<br/>
He sends the snow in winter,<br/>
The warmth to swell the grain,<br/>
The breezes and the sunshine,<br/>
And soft, refreshing rain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
All good gifts around us<br/>
Are sent from heaven above;<br/>
Then thank the Lord,<br/>
O thank the Lord,<br/>
For all his love.<br/>
<br/>
He only is the maker<br/>
Of all things near and far;<br/>
He paints the wayside flower,<br/>
He lights the evening star;<br/>
The winds and waves obey him,<br/>
By him the birds are fed;<br/>
Much more to us, his children,<br/>
He gives our daily bread.<br/>
<br/>
We thank thee then, O Father,<br/>
For all things bright and good,<br/>
The seed time and the harvest,<br/>
Our life, our health, our food.<br/>
Accept the gifts we offer<br/>
For all thy love imparts,<br/>
And what thou most desirest,<br/>
Our humble, thankful hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
