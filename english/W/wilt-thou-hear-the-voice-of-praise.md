<br/>
Wilt Thou hear the voice of praise<br/>
Which the little children raise,<br/>
Thou Who art, from endless days,<br/>
Glorious God of all?<br/>
While the circling year has sped,<br/>
Thou hast heavenly blessings shed,<br/>
Like the dew, upon each head;<br/>
Still on Thee we call.<br/>
<br/>
Still Thy constant care bestow;<br/>
Let us each in wisdom grow,<br/>
And in favor while below,<br/>
With the God above.<br/>
In our hearts the Spirit mild,<br/>
Which adorned the Savior Child,<br/>
Gently soothe each impulse wild<br/>
To the sway of love.<br/>
<br/>
Thine example, kept in view,<br/>
Jesus, help us to pursue;<br/>
Lead us all our journey through<br/>
By Thy guiding hand;<br/>
And when life on earth is oâ€™er,<br/>
Where the blest dwell evermore,<br/>
May we praise Thee and adore,<br/>
An unbroken band.<br/>
