title: With Firm Resolve I Held My Peace

<br/>
With firm resolve I held my peace<br/>
And spake not either bad or good,<br/>
Lest I should utter sinful thoughts<br/>
While wicked men before me stood.<br/>
<br/>
While I was dumb my grief was stirred,<br/>
My heart grew hot with thought suppressed;<br/>
The while I mused the fire increased,<br/>
Then to the Lord I made request.<br/>
<br/>
Make me, O Lord, to know my end,<br/>
Teach me the measure of my days,<br/>
That I may know how frail I am<br/>
And turn from pride and sinful ways.<br/>
<br/>
My time is nothing in Thy sight,<br/>
Behold, my days are but a span;<br/>
Yea, truly, at his best estate,<br/>
A breath, a fleeting breath, is man.<br/>
<br/>
Manâ€™s life is passed in vain desire<br/>
If troubled years be spent for gain;<br/>
He knows not whose his wealth shall be,<br/>
And all his toil is but in vain.<br/>
<br/>
And now, O Lord, what wait I for?<br/>
I have no hope except in Thee;<br/>
Let not ungodly men reproach,<br/>
From all transgressions set me free.<br/>
<br/>
Because Thou didst it I was dumb,<br/>
I spoke no word of rash complaint;<br/>
Remove Thy stroke away from me,<br/>
Beneath Thy chastisement I faint.<br/>
<br/>
When Thou for his iniquity<br/>
Rebukest and correctest man,<br/>
His beauty is consumed away;<br/>
How weak his strength, how vain his plan.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, hear my prayer, regard my cry;<br/>
I weep; be Thou my Comforter.<br/>
I am a stranger here below,<br/>
A pilgrim as my fathers were.<br/>
<br/>
O spare me, Lord, avert Thy wrath,<br/>
Deal gently with me, I implore,<br/>
That I may yet recover strength<br/>
Ere I go hence and be no more.<br/>
