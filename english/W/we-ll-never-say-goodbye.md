title: Well Never Say Goodbye
---

<center>
<br/>
With friends on earth we meet in gladness,<br/>
While swift the moments fly,<br/>
Yet ever comes the tho’t of sadness,<br/>
That we must say, “Goodbye.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye in Heav’n,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye,<br/>
For in that land of joy and song,<br/>
We’ll never say goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
How joyful is the hope that lingers,<br/>
When loved ones cross death’s sea,<br/>
That we, when all earth’s toils are ended,<br/>
With Thee shall ever be.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
No parting words shall e’er be spoken,<br/>
In yonder home so fair,<br/>
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,<br/>
We’ll sing forever there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
