title: When I Awake From Slumber

<center>
When I awake from slumber<br/>
To greet the golden day,<br/>
Then teach me, Lord, to number<br/>
Its hours in wisdom’s way.<br/>
<br/>
When clouds at dawn are gleaming,<br/>
Lift up mine answering eyes<br/>
To where Thy light is streaming<br/>
On faith’s high enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
While all the heights are calling<br/>
And skies are blithe and blue,<br/>
Keep Thou my feet from falling,<br/>
My heart’s ambitions true.<br/>
<br/>
Let simple pleasures cheer me<br/>
When every goal seems far;<br/>
Reveal Thyself as near me<br/>
As life and duty are.<br/>
<br/>
And when the light is fading,<br/>
If dreams have not come true,<br/>
Yet breathe Thy peace pervading<br/>
The twilight through and through.<br/>
<br/>
When life’s long day is ended<br/>
And shadows closer creep,<br/>
Lord, let me feel befriended<br/>
Before I go to sleep.
