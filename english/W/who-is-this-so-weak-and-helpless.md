Who is this so weak and helpless, Child of lowly Hebrew maid,<br/>
Rudely in a stable sheltered, coldly in a manger laid?<br/>
’Tis the Lord of all creation, Who this wondrous path hath trod;<br/>
He is God from everlasting, and to everlasting God.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this, a Man of sorrows, walking sadly life’s hard way,<br/>
Homeless, weary, sighing, weeping, over sin and Satan’s sway?<br/>
’Tis our God, our glorious Savior, Who above the starry sky<br/>
Now for us a place prepareth, where no tear can dim the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this? Behold Him shedding drops of blood upon the ground!<br/>
Who is this, despised, rejected, mocked, insulted, beaten, bound?<br/>
’Tis our God, Who gifts and graces on His church now poureth down;<br/>
Who shall smite in righteous judgment all His foes beneath His throne.<br/>
<br/>
Who is this that hangeth dying while the rude world scoffs and scorns,<br/>
Numbered with the malefactors, torn with nails, and crowned with thorns?<br/>
’Tis the God Who ever liveth, ’mid the shining ones on high,<br/>
In the glorious golden city, reigning everlastingly.
