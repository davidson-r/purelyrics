title: When The Dark Waves Round Us Roll

<br/>
When the dark waves round us roll,<br/>
And we look in vain for aid,<br/>
Speak, Lord, to the trembling soul,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
When we dimly trace Thy form<br/>
In mysterious clouds arrayed,<br/>
Be the echo of the storm,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
When our brightest hopes depart,<br/>
When our fairest visions fade,<br/>
Whisper to the fainting heart,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
When we weep beside the bier<br/>
Where some well-loved form is laid,<br/>
O may then the mourner hear,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
When with wearing hopeless pain<br/>
Sinks the spirit, sore dismayed,<br/>
Breathe Thou then the comfort-strain,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
<br/>
When we feel the end is near,<br/>
Passing into death’s dark shade,<br/>
May the voice be strong and clear,<br/>
“It is I; be not afraid.”<br/>
