title: While With Ceaseless Course The Sun

<br/>
While with ceaseless course the sun<br/>
Hasted through the former year,<br/>
Many souls their race have run,<br/>
Never more to meet us here;<br/>
Fixed in an eternal fate,<br/>
They have done with all below;<br/>
We a little longer wait,<br/>
But how little none can know.<br/>
<br/>
As the wingèd arrow flies<br/>
Speedily the mark to find;<br/>
As the lightning from the skies<br/>
Darts, and leaves no trace behind;<br/>
Swiftly thus our fleeting days<br/>
Bear us down life’s rapid stream;<br/>
Upwards, Lord, our spirits raise,<br/>
All below is but a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for mercies past receive,<br/>
Pardon of our sins renew;<br/>
Teach us, henceforth, how to live<br/>
With eternity in view:<br/>
Bless Thy Word to young and old,<br/>
Fill us with a Savior’s love;<br/>
And when life’s short tale is told,<br/>
May we dwell with Thee above.<br/>
