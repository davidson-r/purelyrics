<br/>
When Christ’s appearing was made known,<br/>
King Herod trembled for his throne;<br/>
But He Who offers heavenly birth<br/>
Sought not the kingdom of this earth.<br/>
<br/>
The eastern sages saw from far<br/>
And followed on His guiding star;<br/>
By light their way to Light they trod,<br/>
And by their gifts confessed their God.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Jordan’s sacred flood<br/>
The heavenly Lamb in meekness stood,<br/>
That He, to Whom no sin was known,<br/>
Might cleanse His people from their own.<br/>
<br/>
And O what miracle divine,<br/>
When water reddened into wine!<br/>
He spake the word, and forth it flowed<br/>
In streams that nature ne’er bestowed.<br/>
<br/>
All glory, Jesus, be to Thee<br/>
For this Thy glad epiphany:<br/>
Whom with the Father we adore<br/>
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br/>
