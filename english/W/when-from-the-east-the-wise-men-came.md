<br/>
When from the East the wise men came,<br/>
Led by the Star of Bethlehem,<br/>
The gifts they brought to Jesus were<br/>
Of gold and frankincense and myrrh.<br/>
<br/>
Bright gold of Ophir, passing fine,<br/>
Proclaims a king of royal line;<br/>
For David’s son in David’s town,<br/>
Is born the heir of David’s crown.<br/>
<br/>
The incense clouds, with fragrance rare,<br/>
The presence of a God declare;<br/>
Lo! kings in adoration fall,<br/>
For Mary’s Son is Lord of all.<br/>
<br/>
The myrrh, with bitter taste, foreshows,<br/>
A life of sorrows, wounds, and woes;<br/>
The deadly cup, that overran<br/>
With anguish for the Son of Man.<br/>
<br/>
Our gold upon Thine altar lies;<br/>
Our prayers to Thee, as incense, rise;<br/>
Accept as myrrh our tears and sighs;<br/>
O King, O God, O Sacrifice.<br/>
