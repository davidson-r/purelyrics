title: When On My Day Of Life

<center>
<br/>
When on my day of life the night is falling,<br/>
And in the winds, from unsunned spaces blown,<br/>
I hear far voices out of darkness calling<br/>
My feet to paths unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Who hast made my home of life so pleasant,<br/>
Leave not its tenant when its walls decay;<br/>
O Love divine, O Helper ever present,<br/>
Be Thou my strength and stay!<br/>
<br/>
Be near me when all else is from me drifting—<br/>
Earth, sky, home’s pictures, days of shade and shine,<br/>
And kindly faces to my own uplifting<br/>
The love which answers mine.<br/>
<br/>
I have but Thee, my Father; let Thy Spirit<br/>
Be with me then to comfort and uphold;<br/>
No gate of pearl, no branch of palm I merit,<br/>
Nor street of shining gold.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it if—my good and ill unreckoned,<br/>
And both forgiven through Thy abounding grace—<br/>
I find myself by hands familiar beckoned<br/>
Unto my fitting place.<br/>
<br/>
Some humble door among Thy many mansions,<br/>
Some sheltering shade where sin and striving cease,<br/>
And flows forever through heaven’s green expansions<br/>
The river of Thy peace.<br/>
<br/>
There from the music round about me stealing<br/>
I fain would learn the new and holy song,<br/>
And find at last, beneath Thy trees of healing,<br/>
The life for which I long.<br/>
