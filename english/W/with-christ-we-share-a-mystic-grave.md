title: With Christ We Share A Mystic Grave

<br/>
With Christ we share a mystic grave,<br/>
With Christ we buried lie;<br/>
But ’tis not in the darksome cave<br/>
By mournful Calvary.<br/>
<br/>
The pure and bright baptismal flood<br/>
Entombs our nature’s stain;<br/>
New creatures from the cleansing wave<br/>
With Christ we rise again.<br/>
<br/>
Thrice blest, if through this world of strife,<br/>
And sin, and selfish care,<br/>
Our snow white robe of righteousness<br/>
We undefilèd wear.<br/>
<br/>
Thrice blest, if through the gate of death<br/>
All glorious and free<br/>
We to our joyful rising pass,<br/>
O risen Lord, with Thee.<br/>
