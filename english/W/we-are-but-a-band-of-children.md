title: We Are But A Band Of Children

<center>
We are but a band of children,<br/>
We are few, and weak and small,<br/>
But we want to work for Jesus,<br/>
And there’s work enough for all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are a missionary band,<br/>
Missionary band, missionary band;<br/>
We are a missionary band,<br/>
Doing all we can.<br/>
<br/>
There are many little children,<br/>
Far away across the sea,<br/>
Who have never heard of Jesus,<br/>
But to idols bend the knee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
So we want to send them teachers,<br/>
Who will teach them how to pray,<br/>
To the dear and loving Savior,<br/>
Who will wash their sins away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
It was Jesus died to save them,<br/>
’Twas for this to earth He came;<br/>
He will make them pure and happy,<br/>
When they learn to love His Name.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
’Tis the Bible that will lead them<br/>
From the darkness into light,<br/>
And we all are glad to help them<br/>
Break away from heathen night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully we give our pennies,<br/>
And we like to give and plan,<br/>
For we are young missionaries,<br/>
Doing all the good we can.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
