<br/>
We gather together to ask the Lordâ€™s blessing;<br/>
He chastens and hastens His will to make known.<br/>
The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.<br/>
Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.<br/>
<br/>
Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,<br/>
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;<br/>
So from the beginning the fight we were winning;<br/>
Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!<br/>
<br/>
We all do extol Thee, Thou Leader triumphant,<br/>
And pray that Thou still our Defender will be.<br/>
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;<br/>
Thy Name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!<br/>
