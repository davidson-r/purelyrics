<br/>
When Mary, immaculate, tender and mild,<br/>
Could find but a manger as crib for her Child,<br/>
Her pure heart rejoiced in the Infant so fair,<br/>
Protected by Joseph, the holy one, near. <br/>
<br/>
When Mary, saw Jesus, her baby, asleep,<br/>
His pillow, the straw in a stable for sheep,<br/>
Her sorrow was great when, behold from the sky,<br/>
Bright choirs of God's angels brought joy from on high. <br/>
<br/>
When Mary thought sadly that Christ the great King,<br/>
Had none but poor shepherds their homage to bring,<br/>
Then kings from the Orient came to adore,<br/>
And Mary, His mother, was joyful once more. <br/>
<br/>
When Mary lost Jesus and sought in despair,<br/>
She looked in the temple and lo, He was there.<br/>
The heart of the mother was filled with great joy<br/>
To find midst the doctors her well-beloved Boy. <br/>
<br/>
When Mary saw Jesus on Calvary's hill,<br/>
The crucified Victim, obeying God's will,<br/>
A sword pierced her heart, yet she knew, though she wept,<br/>
That Christ, our Redeemer, was God's promise kept. <br/>
