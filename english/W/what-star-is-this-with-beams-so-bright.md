<br/>
What star is this, with beams so bright,<br/>
More lovely than the noonday light?<br/>
’Tis sent to announce a newborn King,<br/>
Glad tidings of our God to bring.<br/>
<br/>
’Tis now fulfilled what God decreed,<br/>
“From Jacob shall a star proceed”;<br/>
And lo! the Eastern sages stand<br/>
To read in heaven the Lord’s command.<br/>
<br/>
While outward signs the star displays,<br/>
An inward light the Lord conveys,<br/>
And urges them, with force benign,<br/>
To seek the Giver of the sign.<br/>
<br/>
True love can brook no dull delay;<br/>
Nor toil nor dangers stop their way<br/>
Home, kindred, father land and all<br/>
They leave at their Creator’s call.<br/>
<br/>
O, while the star of heavenly grace<br/>
Invites us, Lord, to seek Thy face,<br/>
May we no more that grace repel,<br/>
Or quench that light which shines so well!<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father, God the Son,<br/>
And Holy Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
May every tongue and nation raise<br/>
An endless song of thankful praise!<br/>
