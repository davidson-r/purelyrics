title: Will The Angels Come

<center>
<br/>
When I have finished my journey on earth,<br/>
Ended my labor of love,<br/>
When I am waiting for Jesus to say,<br/>
“Haste to thy mansion above.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Will they come? Will they come?<br/>
Say, will the angels come,<br/>
And to Jesus carry me home?<br/>
Will they come? Will they come?<br/>
Say, will the angels come,<br/>
And to Jesus carry me home?<br/>
<br/>
When I am breathing my latest farewell,<br/>
Parting from all that is dear,<br/>
When on my pillow I wearily turn,<br/>
Say, will the angels be near?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When, as I gaze from the threshold of time,<br/>
Fainter and fainter the light,<br/>
Softer and softer the voices I hear,<br/>
Bidding my spirit good night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Yes; they will come from the bright, sunny land,<br/>
Come on their pinions so fair;<br/>
Jesus will send them its glory to tell,<br/>
Angels will carry me there.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
