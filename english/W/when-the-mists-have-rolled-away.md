title: When The Mists Have Rolled Away
---

---
<center>
When the mists have rolled in splendor<br/>
From the beauty of the hills,<br/>
And the sunlight falls in gladness<br/>
On the rivers and the rills,<br/>
We recall our Father’s promise<br/>
In the rainbow of the spray:<br/>
We shall know each other better<br/>
When the mists have rolled away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We shall know, as we are known,<br/>
Never more to walk alone,<br/>
In the dawning of the morning<br/>
Of that bright and happy day,<br/>
We shall know each other better,<br/>
When the mists have rolled away.<br/>
<br/>
Oft we tread the path before us<br/>
With a weary, hardened heart.<br/>
Oft we toil amid the shadows,<br/>
And our fields are far apart.<br/>
But the Savior’s “Come, ye blessèd”<br/>
All our labor will repay<br/>
When we gather in the morning<br/>
Where the mists have rolled away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We shall come with joy and gladness,<br/>
We shall gather round the throne.<br/>
Face to face with those that love us<br/>
We shall know as we are known.<br/>
And the song of our redemption<br/>
Shall resound through endless day<br/>
When the shadows have departed<br/>
And the mists have rolled away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
