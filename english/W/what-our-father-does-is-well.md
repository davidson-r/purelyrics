<br/>
What our Father does is well;<br/>
Bless√®d truth His children tell!<br/>
Though He send, for plenty, want,<br/>
Though the harvest-store be scant,<br/>
Yet we rest upon His love,<br/>
Seeking better things above.<br/>
<br/>
What our Father does is well;<br/>
Shall the willful heart rebel?<br/>
If a blessing He withhold<br/>
In the field, or in the fold,<br/>
Is it not Himself to be<br/>
All our store eternally?<br/>
<br/>
What our Father does is well;<br/>
Though He sadden hill and dell,<br/>
Upward yet our praises rise<br/>
For the strength His Word supplies;<br/>
He has called us sons of God,<br/>
Can we murmur at His rod?<br/>
<br/>
What our Father does is well;<br/>
May the thought within us dwell;<br/>
Though nor milk nor honey flow<br/>
In our barren Canaan now,<br/>
God can save us in our need,<br/>
God can bless us, God can feed.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore unto Him we raise<br/>
Hymns of glory, songs of praise;<br/>
To the Father, and the Son,<br/>
And the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
Honor, might, and glory be<br/>
Now, and through eternity.<br/>
