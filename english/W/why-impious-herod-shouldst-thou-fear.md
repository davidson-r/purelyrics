<br/>
Why, impious Herod, shouldst thou fear<br/>
Because the Christ is come so near?<br/>
He Who doth heavenly kingdoms grant<br/>
Thine earthly realm can never want.<br/>
<br/>
Lo, sages from the East are gone<br/>
To where the star hath newly shone:<br/>
Led on by light to Light they press,<br/>
And by their gifts their God confess.<br/>
<br/>
The Lamb of God is manifest<br/>
Again in Jordanâ€™s water blest,<br/>
And He Who sin had never known<br/>
By washing hath our sins undone.<br/>
<br/>
Yet He that ruleth everything<br/>
Can change the nature of the spring,<br/>
And gives at Cana this for sign<br/>
The water reddens into wine.<br/>
<br/>
Then glory, Lord, to Thee we pay<br/>
For thine Epiphany today;<br/>
All glory through eternity<br/>
To Father, Son, and Spirit be.<br/>
