<br/>
When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
When you begin the day, O never fail to say,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
And at your work rejoice, to sing with heart and voice,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Whene’er the sweet church bell peals over hill and dell,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
My tongue shall never tire of chanting with the choir,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
This song of sacred joy, it never seems to cloy,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Does sadness fill my mind? A solace here I find,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Or fades my earthly bliss? My comfort still is this,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
To God, the Word, on high, the host of angels cry,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Let mortals, too, upraise their voice in hymns of praise,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Be this at meals your grace, in every time and place;<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Be this, when day is past, of all your thoughts the last<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
When mirth for music longs, this is my song of songs:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
When evening shadows fall, this rings my curfew call,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
When sleep her balm denies, my silent spirit sighs,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
When evil thoughts molest, with this I shield my breast,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
No lovelier antiphon in all high Heav’n is known<br/>
Than, Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
There to the eternal Word the eternal psalm is heard:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
In Heaven’s eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Sing, suns and stars of space, sing, ye that see His face,<br/>
Sing, Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
God’s whole creation o’er, for aye and evermore<br/>
Shall Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
In Heav’n’s eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
<br/>
Be this, while life is mine, my canticle divine:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
Sing this eternal song through all the ages long:<br/>
May Jesus Christ be praised!<br/>
