<br/>
We shall sleep, but not forever,<br/>
There will be a glorious dawn!<br/>
We shall meet to part, no, never,<br/>
On the resurrection morn!<br/>
From the deepest cave of ocean,<br/>
From the desert and the plain,<br/>
From the valley and the mountain,<br/>
Countless throngs shall rise again.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We shall sleep, but not forever,<br/>
There will be a glorious dawn!<br/>
We shall meet, to part, no, never,<br/>
On the resurrection morn!<br/>
<br/>
When we see a precious blossom,<br/>
That we tended with such care,<br/>
Rudely taken from our bosom,<br/>
How our aching hearts despair!<br/>
Round its little grave we linger,<br/>
Till the setting sun is low,<br/>
Feeling all our hopes have perished,<br/>
With the flow’r we cherished so.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We shall sleep, but not forever,<br/>
In the lone and silent grave:<br/>
Blessèd be the Lord that taketh,<br/>
Blessèd be the Lord that gave.<br/>
In the bright eternal city,<br/>
Death can never, never come!<br/>
In His own good time He’ll call us,<br/>
From our rest, to home, sweet home.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
