title: We Are Going Down The Valley

<br/>
We are going down the valley one by one,<br/>
With our faces tow’rd the setting of the sun;<br/>
Down the valley where the mournful cypress grows,<br/>
Where the stream of death in silence onward flows.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are going down the valley,<br/>
Going down the valley,<br/>
Going tow’rd the setting of the sun;<br/>
We are going down the valley,<br/>
Going down the valley,<br/>
Going down the valley one by one.<br/>
<br/>
We are going down the valley one by one,<br/>
When the labors of the weary day are done;<br/>
One by one, the cares of earth forever past,<br/>
We shall stand upon the river brink at last.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are going down the valley one by one:<br/>
Human comrade you or I will there have none;<br/>
But a tender hand will guide us lest we fall:<br/>
Christ is going down the valley with us all.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are going down the valley one by one:<br/>
Yet before the shadowed vale may come the dawn,<br/>
When with rapture we shall gather in the sky;<br/>
“We shall be changed,” but some shall never die!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
