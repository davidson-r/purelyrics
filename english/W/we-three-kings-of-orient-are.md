<br/>
We three kings of Orient are<br/>
Bearing gifts we traverse afar<br/>
Field and fountain, moor and mountain<br/>
Following yonder star<br/>
<br/>
O Star of wonder, star of night<br/>
Star with royal beauty bright<br/>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br/>
Guide us to thy Perfect Light<br/>
<br/>
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain<br/>
Gold I bring to crown Him again<br/>
King forever, ceasing never<br/>
Over us all to rein<br/>
<br/>
O Star of wonder, star of night<br/>
Star with royal beauty bright<br/>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br/>
Guide us to Thy perfect light<br/>
<br/>
Frankincense to offer have I<br/>
Incense owns a Deity nigh<br/>
Pray'r and praising, all men raising<br/>
Worship Him, God most high<br/>
<br/>
O Star of wonder, star of night<br/>
Star with royal beauty bright<br/>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br/>
Guide us to Thy perfect light<br/>
<br/>
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume<br/>
Breathes of life of gathering gloom<br/>
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying<br/>
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb<br/>
<br/>
O Star of wonder, star of night<br/>
Star with royal beauty bright<br/>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br/>
Guide us to Thy perfect light<br/>
<br/>
Glorious now behold Him arise<br/>
King and God and Sacrifice<br/>
Alleluia, Alleluia<br/>
Earth to heav'n replies<br/>
<br/>
O Star of wonder, star of night<br/>
Star with royal beauty bright<br/>
Westward leading, still proceeding<br/>
Guide us to Thy perfect light .<br/>
