<br/>
We will follow Jesus,<br/>
Though we may be small;<br/>
Gladly may we listen<br/>
To His loving call.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Little ones may follow,<br/>
Follow all the way.<br/>
Jesus bids us follow<br/>
Every passing day.<br/>
<br/>
We will follow Jesus,<br/>
Everywhere He leads;<br/>
Show Him unto others<br/>
By our loving deeds.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We will follow Jesus,<br/>
To the lands afar,<br/>
Till each tribe and nation<br/>
See the “Morning Star.”<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Just to follow Jesus,<br/>
Makes the day seem bright,<br/>
Fills the heart with singing,<br/>
Through the darkest night.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
