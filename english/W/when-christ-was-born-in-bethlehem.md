<br/>
When Christ was born in Bethlehem,<br/>
Fair peace on earth to bring,<br/>
In lowly state of love He came<br/>
To be the children’s King.<br/>
<br/>
And round Him, then, a holy band<br/>
Of children blest was born,<br/>
Fair guardians of His throne to stand<br/>
Attendant night and morn.<br/>
<br/>
And unto them this grace was giv’n<br/>
A Savior’s name to own,<br/>
And die for Him Who out of Heav’n<br/>
Had found on earth a throne.<br/>
<br/>
O blessèd babes of Bethlehem,<br/>
Who died to save our King,<br/>
Ye share the martyrs’ diadem,<br/>
And in their anthem sing!<br/>
<br/>
Your lips, on earth that never spake,<br/>
Now sound th’eternal word;<br/>
And in the courts of love ye make<br/>
Your children’s voices heard.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal Child,<br/>
Make Thou our childhood Thine;<br/>
That we with Thee the meek and mild<br/>
May share the love divine.<br/>
