<br/>
“What means this glory round our feet,”<br/>
The Magi mused, “more bright than morn!”<br/>
And voices chanted clear and sweet,<br/>
“Today the Prince of Peace is born!”<br/>
“What means this star,” the shepherds said,<br/>
“That brightens through the rocky glen?”<br/>
And angels answering overhead,<br/>
Sang “Peace on earth, good will to men!”<br/>
<br/>
’Tis now two thousand years, and more,<br/>
[originally ’Tis eighteen hundred years, and more]<br/>
Since those sweet oracles were dumb;<br/>
We wait for Him, like them of yore;<br/>
Alas! He seems so slow to come!<br/>
But it was said, in words of gold,<br/>
No time nor sorrow e’er shall dim,<br/>
That little children might be bold,<br/>
In perfect trust to come to Him.<br/>
<br/>
All round about our feet shall shine<br/>
A light like that the wise men saw,<br/>
If we our loving wills incline<br/>
To that sweet Life which is the Law.<br/>
So shall we learn to understand<br/>
The simple faith of shepherds then,<br/>
And kindly clasping hand in hand,<br/>
Sing “Peace on earth, good will to men!”<br/>
