title: Who Shall The Lords Elect Condemn

<br/>
Who shall the Lord’s elect condemn?<br/>
’Tis God that justifies their souls;<br/>
And mercy, like a mighty stream,<br/>
O’er all their sins divinely rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?<br/>
’Tis Christ that suffered in their stead;<br/>
And, the salvation to fulfill,<br/>
Behold Him rising from the dead!<br/>
<br/>
He lives! He lives and sits above,<br/>
For ever interceding there:<br/>
Who shall divide us from His love?<br/>
Or what should tempt us to despair?<br/>
<br/>
Shall persecution, or distress,<br/>
Famine, or sword, or nakedness?<br/>
He that hath loved us bears us through,<br/>
And makes us more than conquerors too.<br/>
<br/>
Faith hath an overcoming power;<br/>
It triumphs in the dying hour:<br/>
Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,<br/>
Nor can we sink with such a prop.<br/>
<br/>
Not all that men on earth can do,<br/>
Nor powers on high, nor powers below,<br/>
Shall cause His mercy to remove,<br/>
Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.<br/>
