title: When Wise Men came seeking

<br/>
When wise men came seeking for Jesus from far,<br/>
With rich gifts to greet Him and led by a star,<br/>
They found in a stable the Savior of men,<br/>
A manger His cradle, so poor was He then.<br/>
<br/>
Though laid in a manger, He came from a throne,<br/>
On earth though a stranger, in Heaven He was known.<br/>
How lowly, how gracious His coming to earth!<br/>
His love my love kindles to joy in His birth.<br/>
