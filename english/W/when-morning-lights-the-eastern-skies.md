<br/>
When morning lights the eastern skies,<br/>
O Lord, Thy mercy show;<br/>
On Thee alone my hope relies,<br/>
Let me Thy kindness know.<br/>
<br/>
Teach me the way that I should go;<br/>
I lift my soul to Thee;<br/>
For refuge from my cruel foe<br/>
To Thee, O Lord, I flee.<br/>
<br/>
Thou art my God, to Thee I pray;<br/>
Teach me Thy will to heed;<br/>
And in the right and perfect way<br/>
May Thy good Spirit lead.<br/>
<br/>
For Thy Nameâ€™s sake, O gracious Lord,<br/>
Revive my soul and bless,<br/>
And in Thy faithfulness and love<br/>
Redeem me from distress.<br/>
