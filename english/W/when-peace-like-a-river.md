title: When Peace Like A River

<br/>
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, <br/>
when sorrows like sea billows roll; <br/>
whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, <br/>
It is well, it is well with my soul. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
It is well with my soul, <br/>
it is well, it is well with my soul.<br/>
Â <br/>
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, <br/>
let this blest assurance control, <br/>
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate, <br/>
and hath shed his own blood for my soul. <br/>
(Refrain) <br/>
<br/>
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! <br/>
My sin, not in part but the whole, <br/>
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, <br/>
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! <br/>
(Refrain) <br/>
<br/>
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, <br/>
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll; <br/>
the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, <br/>
even so, it is well with my soul. <br/>
(Refrain)<br/>
