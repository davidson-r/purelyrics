<br/>
“Welcome, happy morning!” age to age shall say:<br/>
“Hell today is vanquished, Heav’n is won today!”<br/>
Lo! the dead is living, God forevermore!<br/>
Him, their true Creator, all His works adore!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
“Welcome, happy morning!”<br/>
Age to age shall say.<br/>
<br/>
Earth her joy confesses, clothing her for spring,<br/>
All fresh gifts returned with her returning King:<br/>
Bloom in every meadow, leaves on every bough,<br/>
Speak His sorrow ended, hail His triumph now.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Months in due succession, days of lengthening light,<br/>
Hours and passing moments praise Thee in their flight.<br/>
Brightness of the morning, sky and fields and sea,<br/>
Vanquisher of darkness, bring their praise to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Maker and Redeemer, life and health of all,<br/>
Thou from heaven beholding human nature’s fall,<br/>
Of the Father’s Godhead true and only Son,<br/>
Mankind to deliver, manhood didst put on.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou, of life the Author, death didst undergo,<br/>
Tread the path of darkness, saving strength to show;<br/>
Come, then True and Faithful, now fulfill Thy Word;<br/>
’Tis Thine own third morning; rise, O buried Lord!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Loose the souls long prisoned, bound with Satan’s chain;<br/>
All that now is fallen raise to life again;<br/>
Show Thy face in brightness, bid the nations see;<br/>
Bring again our daylight: day returns with Thee!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
