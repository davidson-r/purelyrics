While by my sheep I watched at night, <br/>
Glad tidings brought an angel bright: <br/>
<br/>
Refrain:<br/>
How great my joy, great my joy, <br/>
Joy, joy joy, <br/>
Joy, joy joy, <br/>
Praise we the Lord in heav'n on high. <br/>
Praise we the Lord in heav'n on high. <br/>
<br/>
There shall be born, so He did say, <br/>
In Bethlehem a Child today: <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
<br/>
There shall He lie in manger mean, <br/>
Who shall redeem the world from sin: <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
<br/>
This gift of God we'll cherish well, <br/>
That ever joy my heart shall fill. <br/>
<br/>
Refrain <br/>
<br/>
Lord, evermore to me be nigh, <br/>
Then shall my heart be filled with joy! <br/>
<br/>
Refrain
