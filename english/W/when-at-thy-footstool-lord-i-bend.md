title: When At Thy Footstool Lord I Bend

<center>
When at Thy footstool, Lord, I bend,<br/>
And plead with Thee for mercy there,<br/>
Think of the sinner’s dying Friend,<br/>
And for His sake receive my prayer.<br/>
<br/>
O think not of my shame and guilt,<br/>
My thousand stains of deepest dye;<br/>
Think of the blood which Jesus spilt,<br/>
And let that blood my pardon buy.<br/>
<br/>
Think, Lord, how I am still Thine own,<br/>
The trembling creature of Thy hand;<br/>
Think how my heart to sin is prone,<br/>
And what temptations round me stand.<br/>
<br/>
O think upon Thy holy Word,<br/>
And every plighted promise there;<br/>
How prayer should evermore be heard,<br/>
And how Thy glory is to spare.<br/>
<br/>
O think not of my doubts and fears,<br/>
My strivings with Thy grace divine;<br/>
Think upon Jesus’ woes and tears,<br/>
And let His merits stand for mine.<br/>
<br/>
Thine eyes, Thine ear, they are not dull;<br/>
Thine arm can never shortened be;<br/>
Behold me here; my heart is full;<br/>
Behold, and spare, and succor me.
