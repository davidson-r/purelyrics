title: Why Should Our Tears In Sorrow Flow

<br/>
Why should our tears in sorrow flow<br/>
When God recalls His own;<br/>
And bids them leave a world of woe<br/>
For an immortal crown?<br/>
<br/>
Is not e’en death a gain to those<br/>
Whose life to God was given?<br/>
Gladly to earth their eyes they close<br/>
To open them in Heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Their toils are past, their work is done,<br/>
And they are fully blest;<br/>
They fought the fight, the victory won,<br/>
And entered into rest.<br/>
<br/>
Then let our sorrows cease to flow;<br/>
God has recalled His own;<br/>
But let our hearts, in every woe,<br/>
Still say, “Thy will be done.”<br/>
