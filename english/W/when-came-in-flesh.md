title: When Came In Flesh

<br/>
When came in flesh the incarnate Word,<br/>
The heedless world slept on,<br/>
And only simple shepherds heard<br/>
That God had sent His Son.<br/>
<br/>
When comes the Savior at the last,<br/>
From east to west shall shine<br/>
The awful pomp, and earth aghast<br/>
Shall tremble at the sign.<br/>
<br/>
Then shall the pure of heart be blest;<br/>
As mild He comes to them,<br/>
As when upon the virgin’s breast<br/>
He lay at Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
As mild to meek eyed love and faith,<br/>
Only more strong to save;<br/>
Strengthened by having bowed to death,<br/>
By having burst the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Lord, who could dare see Thee descend<br/>
In state, unless he knew<br/>
Thou art the sorrowing sinner’s Friend,<br/>
The gracious and the true?<br/>
<br/>
Dwell in our hearts, O Savior blest;<br/>
So shall Thine advent’s dawn<br/>
’Twixt us and Thee, our bosom Guest,<br/>
Be but the veil withdrawn.<br/>
