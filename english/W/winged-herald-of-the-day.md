<br/>
The wingèd herald of the day<br/>
Proclaims the morn’s approaching ray:<br/>
And Christ the Lord our souls excites,<br/>
And so to endless life invites.<br/>
<br/>
Take up thy bed, to each He cries,<br/>
Who sick or wrapped in slumber lies;<br/>
And chaste and just and sober stand<br/>
And watch: My coming is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
With earnest cry, with tearful care,<br/>
Call we the Lord to hear our prayer;<br/>
While supplication, pure and deep,<br/>
Forbids each chastened heart to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Do Thou, O Christ, our slumber wake:<br/>
Do Thou the chains of darkness break;<br/>
Purge Thou our former sins away,<br/>
And in our souls new light display.<br/>
<br/>
All laud to God the Father be,<br/>
All praise, eternal Son, to Thee;<br/>
All glory, as is ever meet,<br/>
To God the holy Paraclete.<br/>
