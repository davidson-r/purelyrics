title: We Are Nearing

<center>
<br/>
We are drifting towards the waters<br/>
Of a calm and tranquil sea,<br/>
And we soon shall anchor safely<br/>
In that port where we should be.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are nearing, we are nearing,<br/>
Nearing the golden strand;<br/>
We are nearing, we are nearing,<br/>
Nearing the soul’s bright land.<br/>
<br/>
We are drifting from the sorrows<br/>
That for us will soon be o’er;<br/>
We are drifting from the trials<br/>
That will vex the heart no more.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We are drifting from the shadows<br/>
Into pure and perfect day;<br/>
’Tis the Savior guides our vessel,<br/>
And His presence cheers our way.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the morning and the meeting,<br/>
When our happy souls shall rest,<br/>
By the fount of life eternal,<br/>
With the ransomed ever blest.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
