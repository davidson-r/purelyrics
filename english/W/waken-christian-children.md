Waken! Christian children,<br/>
Up and let us sing,<br/>
With glad voice the praises<br/>
Of our newborn King.<br/>
<br/>
Up! ’tis meet to welcome<br/>
With a joyous lay<br/>
Christ, the King of Glory,<br/>
Born for us today.<br/>
<br/>
Come, nor fear to seek Him,<br/>
Children though we be;<br/>
Once He said of children,<br/>
“Let them come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
In a manger lowly<br/>
Sleeps the heav’nly Child;<br/>
O’er Him fondly bendeth<br/>
Mary, mother mild.<br/>
<br/>
Far above that stable,<br/>
Up in Heav’n so high,<br/>
One bright star out-shineth,<br/>
Watching silently.<br/>
<br/>
Fear not then to enter,<br/>
Though we cannot bring<br/>
Gold, or myrrh, or incense<br/>
Fitting for a King.<br/>
<br/>
Gifts He asketh richer,<br/>
Offerings costlier still,<br/>
Yet may Christian children<br/>
Bring them if they will.<br/>
<br/>
Brighter than all jewels<br/>
Shines the modest eye;<br/>
Best of gifts He loveth<br/>
Infant purity.<br/>
<br/>
Haste we then to welcome<br/>
With a joyous lay<br/>
Christ, the King of Glory,<br/>
Born for us today.
