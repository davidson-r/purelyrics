title: We All Can Do Something For Jesus

<center>
<br/>
Our school is a vineyard, a garden of truth,<br/>
Where all can do something for Jesus;<br/>
And though we are just in the morning of youth,<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus;<br/>
The deep, rolling river that flows to the sea<br/>
Is made of the brooklet that sparkles so free;<br/>
A lesson, dear children, for you and for me,<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus.<br/>
The deep, rolling river that flows to the sea<br/>
Is made of the brooklet that sparkles so free.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus,<br/>
Something, something,<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus,<br/>
Something for Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
A word to the erring, of kindness and love,<br/>
May often remind them of Jesus;<br/>
A song of our beautiful mansion above,<br/>
May lead a poor wandâ€™rer to Jesus;<br/>
The acorn, when planted, though small it may be,<br/>
How quickly it grows to a wide spreading tree;<br/>
A lesson, dear children, for you and for me,<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus.<br/>
The acorn, when planted, though small it may be,<br/>
How quickly it grows to a wide spreading tree.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Oh! sweeter, far sweeter, than riches or fame,<br/>
To feel we are working for Jesus;<br/>
The cup of cold water we give in His Name,<br/>
Will bring us the blessings of Jesus;<br/>
The brook and the acorn, the leaf and the tree<br/>
Are teaching a lesson to you and to me;<br/>
No matter how simple the effort may be,<br/>
We all can do something for Jesus.<br/>
The brook and the acorn, the leaf and the tree<br/>
Are teaching a lesson to you and to me.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
