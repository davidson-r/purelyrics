title: When My Weary Hands Are Folded
---

---
<center>
When my weary hands are folded on my faintly throbbing breast,<br/>
And my soul has spread her pinions for the city of the blest;<br/>
’Twill be sweet to hear the loved ones sing some dear, familiar song,<br/>
As I rise to join the chorus of the blood-washed, holy throng.<br/>
<br/>
But a greater joy ’twill give me if some toiling one can say,<br/>
I have helped to bear his burden and have cheered him on the way;<br/>
Oh! I’ll praise His grace forever Who hath died to ransom me,<br/>
And hath chosen me a sharer in His blessèd work to be.<br/>
<br/>
When the songs of earth are over, and my last “goodbye” is said,<br/>
When my lifeless form they follow to the dwelling of the dead;<br/>
’Twill be sweet if friends remember and shall mark the quiet spot,<br/>
Telling only that the sleeper hath not quickly been forgot.<br/>
<br/>
But if one poor, weary wand’rer shall be guided home by me,<br/>
’Twere a grander, nobler monument, throughout all eternity;<br/>
And to Him shall be the glory, unto Whom all praise is due,<br/>
For the love that hath redeemed us, and hath made my heaven two.<br/>
<br/>
When among the ransomed millions by His grace redeemed I stand,<br/>
Then my song shall swell the chorus of the glad, triumphant band;<br/>
Oh, how sweet will be the resting when my conflicts are all past,<br/>
Oh, the mighty “Alleluia” of our victory at last!
