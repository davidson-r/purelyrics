<br/>
We sing His love, Who once was slain,<br/>
Who soon o’er death revived again,<br/>
That all His saints through Him might have<br/>
Eternal conquests o’er the grave.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Soon shall the trumpet sound, and we<br/>
Shall rise to immortality.<br/>
<br/>
The saints who now with Jesus sleep<br/>
His own almighty power shall keep,<br/>
Till dawns the bright illustrious day<br/>
When death itself shall die away.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
How loud shall our glad voices sing,<br/>
When Christ His risen saints shall bring,<br/>
From beds of dust and silent clay,<br/>
To realms of everlasting day!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When Jesus we in glory meet,<br/>
Our utmost joys shall be complete,<br/>
When landed on that heavenly shore,<br/>
Death and the curse will be no more.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Hasten, dear Lord, the glorious day,<br/>
And this delightful scene display,<br/>
When all Thy saints from death shall rise<br/>
Raptured in bliss beyond the skies.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
