<br/>
On that bright and golden morning, when the Son of Man shall come,<br/>
And the radiance of His glory we shall see;<br/>
When from ev’ry clime and nation He shall call His people home,<br/>
What a gath’ring of the ransomed that will be!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
What a gath’ring, what a gath’ring,<br/>
What a gath’ring of the ransomed in the summer land of love!<br/>
What a gath’ring, what a gath’ring,<br/>
Of the ransomed in that happy home above.<br/>
<br/>
When the blest, who sleep in Jesus, at His bidding shall arise<br/>
From the silence of the grave, and from the sea,<br/>
And with bodies all celestial they shall meet Him in the skies,<br/>
What a gath’ring and rejoicing there will be!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
When our eyes behold the city, with its many mansions bright,<br/>
And its river, calm and restful, flowing free;<br/>
When the friends that death hath parted shall in bliss again unite,<br/>
What a gath’ring and a greeting there will be!<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
O the King is surely coming, and the time is drawing nigh,<br/>
When the blessèd day of promise we shall see;<br/>
Then the changing “in a moment,” “in the twinkling of an eye,”<br/>
And forever in His presence we shall be.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
