title: Within The Churchs Sacred Fold

Within the Church’s sacred fold,<br/>
By holy sacrament enrolled,<br/>
Another lamb we lay:<br/>
An heir before of sin and shame,<br/>
Now in the holy triune Name<br/>
His guilt is washed away.<br/>
<br/>
O loving Father, Thee we pray<br/>
Look on this babe newborn today,<br/>
Thine own adopted child;<br/>
An angel guard do Thou bestow<br/>
To lead him in Thy paths below,<br/>
And guide him through the wild.<br/>
<br/>
O God the Son, Thou heavenly Vine,<br/>
Protect this tender branch of Thine<br/>
Through all that may betide;<br/>
Forever nourished may he be<br/>
With sap divine that flows from Thee,<br/>
In Thee for aye abide.<br/>
<br/>
Blest Spirit, Whose indwelling grace<br/>
Has given this little one a place<br/>
Among the heirs of life;<br/>
O breathe Thy sevenfold gifts within,<br/>
And keep Thy temple pure from sin<br/>
In midst of worldly strife.<br/>
<br/>
So, holy Trinity, by Thee<br/>
Divinely trained this babe may be<br/>
In faith and hope and love;<br/>
So may he gain, earth’s waves o’erpast,<br/>
His bright inheritance at last<br/>
With all Thy saints above.
