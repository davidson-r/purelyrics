title: Will The Circle Be Unbroken

<center>
There are loved ones in the glory,<br/>
Whose dear forms you often miss;<br/>
When you close your earthly story,<br/>
Will you join them in their bliss?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Will the circle be unbroken<br/>
By and by, by and by?<br/>
In a better home awaiting<br/>
In the sky, in the sky?<br/>
<br/>
In the joyous days of childhood,<br/>
Oft they told of wondrous love,<br/>
Pointed to the dying Savior<br/>
Now they dwell with Him above.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
You remember songs of heaven<br/>
Which you sang with childish voice,<br/>
Do you love the hymns they taught you,<br/>
Or are songs of earth your choice?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
You can picture happy gatherings<br/>
Round the fireside long ago,<br/>
And you think of tearful partings,<br/>
When they left you here below:<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
One by one their seats were emptied,<br/>
One by one they went away;<br/>
Here the circle has been broken<br/>
Will it be complete one day?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
