<center>
When He cometh, when He cometh<br/>
To make up His jewels,<br/>
All His jewels, precious jewels,<br/>
His loved and His own.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Like the stars of the morning,<br/>
His brightness adorning,<br/>
They shall shine in their beauty,<br/>
Bright gems for His crown.<br/>
<br/>
He will gather, He will gather<br/>
The gems for His kingdom;<br/>
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,<br/>
His loved and His own.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Little children, little children,<br/>
Who love their Redeemer,<br/>
Are the jewels, precious jewels,<br/>
His loved and His own.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
