title: With Tearful Eyes I Look Around

<br/>
With tearful eyes I look around;<br/>
Life seems a dark and stormy sea;<br/>
Yet, midst the gloom, I hear a sound,<br/>
A heavenly whisper, “Come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
It tells me of a place of rest;<br/>
It tells me where my soul may flee:<br/>
O to the weary, faint, oppressed,<br/>
How sweet the bidding, “Come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
When the poor heart with anguish learns<br/>
That earthly props resigned must be,<br/>
And from each broken cistern turns,<br/>
It hears the accents, “Come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
When against sin I strive in vain,<br/>
And cannot from its yoke get free,<br/>
Sinking beneath the heavy chain,<br/>
The words arrest me, “Come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
When nature shudders, loath to part<br/>
From all I love, enjoy, and see;<br/>
When a faint chill steals o’er my heart,<br/>
A sweet voice utters, “Come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Come, for all else must fall and die;<br/>
Earth is no resting-place for thee;<br/>
Heavenward direct thy weeping eye,<br/>
I am thy Portion; come to Me.”<br/>
<br/>
O voice of mercy! voice of love!<br/>
In conflict, grief, and agony,<br/>
Support me, cheer me from above,<br/>
And gently whisper, “Come to Me.”<br/>
