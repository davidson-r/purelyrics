When Christmas morn is dawning<br/>
In faith I would repair<br/>
Unto the lowly manger;<br/>
My Savior lieth there,<br/>
Unto the lowly manger;<br/>
My Savior lieth there.<br/>
<br/>
How kind, O loving Savior,<br/>
To come from Heav’n above;<br/>
From sin and evil save us,<br/>
And keep us in Thy love,<br/>
From sin and evil save us,<br/>
And keep us in Thy love.<br/>
<br/>
We need Thee, blessèd Jesus,<br/>
Our dearest friend Thou art;<br/>
Forbid that we by sinning<br/>
Should grieve Thy loving heart,<br/>
Forbid that we by sinning<br/>
Should grieve Thy loving heart.
