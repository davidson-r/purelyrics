title: Why Do We Mourn Departing Friends

<br/>
Why do we mourn departing friends,<br/>
Or shake at death’s alarms?<br/>
’Tis but the voice that Jesus sends<br/>
To call them to His arms.<br/>
<br/>
Are we not tending upward, too,<br/>
As fast as time can move?<br/>
Nor would we wish the hours more slow<br/>
To keep us from our love.<br/>
<br/>
Why should we tremble to convey<br/>
Their bodies to the tomb?<br/>
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,<br/>
And left a long perfume.<br/>
<br/>
The graves of all His saints He blessed,<br/>
And softened every bed;<br/>
Where should the dying members rest,<br/>
But with the dying Head?<br/>
<br/>
Thence He arose, ascending high,<br/>
And showed our feet the way;<br/>
Up to the Lord our flesh shall fly,<br/>
At the great rising day.<br/>
<br/>
Then let the last loud trumpet sound,<br/>
And bid our kindred rise;<br/>
Awake, ye nations under ground;<br/>
Ye saints, ascend the skies.<br/>
