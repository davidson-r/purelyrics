title: We Cannot Think Of Them As Dead

<center>
<br/>
We cannot think of them as dead<br/>
Who walk with us no more;<br/>
Along the path of life we tread—<br/>
They have but gone before.<br/>
<br/>
The Father’s house is mansioned fair<br/>
Beyond our vision dim;<br/>
All souls are His, and here or there<br/>
Are living unto Him.<br/>
<br/>
But still their silent ministries<br/>
Within our hearts have place,<br/>
As when on earth they walked with us<br/>
And met us face to face.<br/>
<br/>
Ours are they by an ownership<br/>
Nor time nor death can free;<br/>
For God hath given love to keep<br/>
Its own eternally.<br/>
