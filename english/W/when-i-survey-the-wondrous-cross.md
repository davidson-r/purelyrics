title: When I Survey The Wondrous Cross

<br/>
When I survey the wondrous cross<br/>
On which the Prince of glory died,<br/>
My richest gain I count but loss,<br/>
And pour contempt on all my pride.<br/>
<br/>
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,<br/>
Save in the death of Christ my God!<br/>
All the vain things that charm me most,<br/>
I sacrifice them to His blood.<br/>
<br/>
See from His head, His hands, His feet,<br/>
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!<br/>
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,<br/>
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?<br/>
<br/>
His dying crimson, like a robe,<br/>
Spreads o’er His body on the tree;<br/>
Then I am dead to all the globe,<br/>
And all the globe is dead to me.<br/>
<br/>
Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br/>
That were a present far too small;<br/>
Love so amazing, so divine,<br/>
Demands my soul, my life, my all.<br/>
<br/>
To Christ, Who won for sinners grace<br/>
By bitter grief and anguish sore,<br/>
Be praise from all the ransomed race<br/>
Forever and forevermore.<br/>
