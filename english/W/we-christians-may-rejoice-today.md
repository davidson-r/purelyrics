We Christians may rejoice today<br/>
When Christ was born to comfort and to save us.<br/>
Who thus believes no longer grieves,<br/>
For none are lost who grasp the hope He gave us.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wondrous joy that God most high<br/>
Should take our flesh and thus our race should honor!<br/>
A virgin mild hath borne this Child;<br/>
Such grace and glory God hath put upon her.<br/>
<br/>
Sin brought us grief, but Christ relief,<br/>
When down to earth He came for our salvation.<br/>
Since God with us is dwelling thus,<br/>
Who dares to speak the Christianâ€™s condemnation?<br/>
<br/>
The hither throng with happy song<br/>
To Him Whose birth and death are our assurance;<br/>
Through Whom are we at last set free<br/>
From sins and burdens that surpassed endurance.<br/>
<br/>
Yea, let us praise our God and raise<br/>
Loud hallelujahs to the skies above us.<br/>
The bliss bestowed today by God<br/>
To ceaseless thankfulness and joy should move us.
