title: When Christ Arose

The earth was filled with peace and light,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
The heavens trembled at the sight,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
The sea rejoiced along the sands,<br/>
The vernal valleys clapped their hands,<br/>
The mountains sang, and all the lands,<br/>
When Christ arose.<br/>
<br/>
The tomb was empty where He lay,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
And angels rolled the stone away,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
A sound of triumph thrilled the air,<br/>
The glorious tidings to declare,<br/>
And there was gladness everywhere,<br/>
When Christ arose.<br/>
<br/>
The soul of man was born anew,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
The cross divine appeared in view,<br/>
When Christ arose;<br/>
A glorious light from heaven streamed,<br/>
And from the cross a radiance beamed,<br/>
For evâ€™ry spirit was redeemed,<br/>
When Christ arose.
