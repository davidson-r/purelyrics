title: Where The Gates Swing Outward Never

<center>
<br/>
Just a few more days to be filled with praise,<br/>
And to tell the old, old story;<br/>
Then, when twilight falls, and my Savior calls,<br/>
I shall go to Him in glory.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I’ll exchange my cross for a starry crown,<br/>
Where the gates swing outward never;<br/>
At His feet I’ll lay every burden down,<br/>
And with Jesus reign forever.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few more years with their toil and tears,<br/>
And the journey will be ended;<br/>
Then I’ll be with Him, where the tide of time<br/>
With eternity is blended.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Though the hills be steep and the valleys deep,<br/>
With no flowers my way adorning;<br/>
Though the night be lone and my rest a stone,<br/>
Joy awaits me in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
What a joy ’twill be when I wake to see<br/>
Him for Whom my heart is burning!<br/>
Nevermore to sigh, nevermore to die,<br/>
For that day my heart is yearning.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
