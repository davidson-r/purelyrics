title: Within The Churchyard Side By Side

<center>
<br/>
Within the churchyard, side by side,<br/>
Are many long low graves;<br/>
And some have stones set over them,<br/>
On some the green grass waves.<br/>
<br/>
Full many a little Christian child,<br/>
Woman, and man, lies there;<br/>
And we pass near them every time<br/>
When we go in to prayer.<br/>
<br/>
They cannot hear our footsteps come,<br/>
They do not see us pass;<br/>
They cannot feel the warm bright sun<br/>
That shines upon the grass.<br/>
<br/>
They do not hear when the great bell<br/>
Is ringing overhead;<br/>
They cannot rise and come to church<br/>
With us, for they are dead.<br/>
<br/>
But we believe a day shall come<br/>
When all the dead will rise,<br/>
When they who sleep down in the grass,<br/>
Will ope again their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
For Christ our Lord was buried once,<br/>
He died and rose again,<br/>
He conquered death, He left the grave;<br/>
And so will Christian men.<br/>
<br/>
So when the friends we love the best<br/>
Lie in their churchyard bed,<br/>
We must not cry too bitterly<br/>
Over the happy dead;<br/>
<br/>
Because, for our dear Savior’s sake,<br/>
Our sins are all forgiv’n;<br/>
And Christians only fall asleep<br/>
To wake again in Heav’n.<br/>
