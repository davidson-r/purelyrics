title: We Come In Childhoods Joyfulness

<center>
We come in childhood’s joyfulness,<br/>
We come as children free!<br/>
We offer up, O God! our hearts,<br/>
In trusting love to Thee.<br/>
Well may we bend in solemn joy<br/>
At Thy bright courts above:<br/>
Well may the grateful child rejoice<br/>
In such a Father’s love.<br/>
<br/>
We come not as the mighty come:<br/>
Not as the proud we bow;<br/>
But as the pure in heart should bend,<br/>
Seek we thine altars now.<br/>
“Forbid them not,” the Savior cried,<br/>
“But let them come to Me”;<br/>
O Savior dear, we hear Thy call,<br/>
We come, we come to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
To Thee, Thou Lord of life and light,<br/>
Amid the angel throng,<br/>
We bend the knee, we lift the heart,<br/>
And swell the holy song.<br/>
How blest the children of the Lord,<br/>
Who wait around His throne,<br/>
How sweet to tread the path that leads<br/>
To yonder heavenly home.
