<br/>
O the wonder of the story<br/>
Of the night so long ago,<br/>
In the glimmer of the starlight<br/>
And the whiteness of the snow,<br/>
When the little Prince of Judah<br/>
In His beauty came to birth,<br/>
While the angels sang His glory<br/>
And His sweetness filled the earth!<br/>
<br/>
O the wonder of the story,<br/>
Of the gladness none can tell,<br/>
When the shepherds saw the rising<br/>
Of the Star of Israel,<br/>
And a light from out the manger,<br/>
Reaching far and waxing strong<br/>
Till it touched the darkened shadows<br/>
And the world was wrapped in song!<br/>
<br/>
O the wonder of the story,<br/>
Of the tender joy supreme!<br/>
O the mystery of loving<br/>
And the sweetness of the dream!<br/>
For the little head was pillowed<br/>
On a mother’s loving breast,<br/>
And the Father’s little children<br/>
They shall find the perfect rest!<br/>
