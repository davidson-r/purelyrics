Watchman, tell us of the night,<br/>
What its signs of promise are.<br/>
Traveler, o’er yon mountain’s height,<br/>
See that glory beaming star.<br/>
Watchman, does its beauteous ray<br/>
Aught of joy or hope foretell?<br/>
Traveler, yes—it brings the day,<br/>
Promised day of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
Watchman, tell us of the night;<br/>
Higher yet that star ascends.<br/>
Traveler, blessedness and light,<br/>
Peace and truth its course portends.<br/>
Watchman, will its beams alone<br/>
Gild the spot that gave them birth?<br/>
Traveler, ages are its own;<br/>
See, it bursts o’er all the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Watchman, tell us of the night,<br/>
For the morning seems to dawn.<br/>
Traveler, darkness takes its flight,<br/>
Doubt and terror are withdrawn.<br/>
Watchman, let thy wanderings cease;<br/>
Hie thee to thy quiet home.<br/>
Traveler, lo! the Prince of Peace,<br/>
Lo! the Son of God is come!
