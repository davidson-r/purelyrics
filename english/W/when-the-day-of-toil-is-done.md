title: When The Day Of Toil Is Done

<br/>
When the day of toil is done,<br/>
When the race of life is run,<br/>
Father, grant Thy wearied one<br/>
Rest forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
When the strife of sin is stilled,<br/>
When the foe within is killed,<br/>
Be Thy gracious Word fulfilled:<br/>
Peace forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
When the darkness melts away<br/>
At the breaking of the day,<br/>
Bid us hail the cheering ray:<br/>
Light forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
When the heart by sorrow tried,<br/>
Feels at length its throbs subside,<br/>
Bring us, where all tears are dried,<br/>
Joy forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
When for vanished days we yearn,<br/>
Days that never can return,<br/>
Teach us in Thy love to learn<br/>
Love forevermore.<br/>
<br/>
When the breath of life is flown,<br/>
When the grave must claim its own,<br/>
Lord of life, be ours Thy crown,<br/>
Life forevermore.<br/>
