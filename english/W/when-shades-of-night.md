title: When Shades Of Night

<center>
I wandered in the shades of night,<br/>
Till Jesus came to me,<br/>
And with the sunlight of His love<br/>
Bid all my darkness flee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,<br/>
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;<br/>
Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,<br/>
I have had the sunlight of His love within.<br/>
<br/>
Tho’ clouds may gather in the sky,<br/>
And billows round me roll,<br/>
However dark the world may be<br/>
I’ve sunlight in my soul.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
I cross the wide extended fields,<br/>
I journey o’er the plain,<br/>
And in the sunlight of His love<br/>
I reap the golden grain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Soon I shall see Him as He is,<br/>
The Light that came to me;<br/>
Behold the brightness of His face,<br/>
Throughout eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain
