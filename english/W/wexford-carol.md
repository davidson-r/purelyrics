Good people all, this Christmas time,<br/>
Consider well and bear in mind<br/>
What our good God for us has done,<br/>
In sending His belovèd Son.<br/>
With Mary holy we should pray<br/>
To God with love this Christmas Day;<br/>
In Bethlehem upon the morn<br/>
There was a blest Messiah born.<br/>
<br/>
The night before that happy tide<br/>
The noble virgin and her guide<br/>
Were long time seeking up and down<br/>
To find a lodging in the town.<br/>
But mark how all things came to pass:<br/>
From every door repelled, alas!<br/>
As long foretold, their refuge all<br/>
Was but a humble oxen stall.<br/>
<br/>
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep<br/>
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;<br/>
To whom God’s angels did appear<br/>
Which put the shepherds in great fear.<br/>
“Prepare and go”, the angels said,<br/>
“To Bethlehem, be not afraid;<br/>
For there you’ll find, this happy morn,<br/>
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born.”<br/>
<br/>
With thankful heart and joyful mind,<br/>
The shepherds went the babe to find,<br/>
And as God’s angel has foretold,<br/>
They did our Savior Christ behold.<br/>
Within a manger He was laid,<br/>
And by His side the virgin maid<br/>
Attending to the Lord of Life,<br/>
Who came on earth to end all strife.
