<br/>
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!<br/>
We go not forth alone against the foe;<br/>
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,<br/>
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.<br/>
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,<br/>
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!<br/>
In Thy dear Name, all other names above;<br/>
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,<br/>
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.<br/>
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,<br/>
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.<br/>
<br/>
We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,<br/>
And needing more each day Thy grace to know:<br/>
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing,<br/>
“We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.”<br/>
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing,<br/>
“We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.”<br/>
<br/>
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender!<br/>
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise;<br/>
When passing through the gates of pearly splendor,<br/>
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.<br/>
When passing through the gates of pearly splendor,<br/>
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.<br/>
