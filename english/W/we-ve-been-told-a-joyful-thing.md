We’ve been told a joyful thing,<br/>
News for all the nations.<br/>
Angels have been heard to sing<br/>
Round the shepherd stations,<br/>
One intoned the “Gloria,”<br/>
Others “Alleluia”;<br/>
Peace to all things human;<br/>
War no more for true man.<br/>
<br/>
Up and get you quickly there<br/>
Folk of field and village!<br/>
Over to that stable bare<br/>
Up beyond the tillage.<br/>
There you’ll find a Baby born<br/>
Old before His mother’s morn<br/>
Young with dewy splendor<br/>
Of parent stem so tender.<br/>
<br/>
So we come to pay our vows:<br/>
Hail! God save thee, Mary!<br/>
Joseph, man of this poor house,<br/>
Fortune seems contrary.<br/>
Let us look on Christ the Lord,<br/>
That was sure the angel’s word.<br/>
Swathèd in a manger,<br/>
Welcome, Holy Stranger!
