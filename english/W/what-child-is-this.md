<br/>
What child is this, who, laid to rest<br/>
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?<br/>
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,<br/>
While shepherds watch are keeping?<br/>
This, this is Christ the King,<br/>
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:<br/>
Haste, haste to bring him laud,<br/>
The Babe, the Son of Mary!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,<br/>
Come peasant king to own Him,<br/>
The King of kings, salvation brings,<br/>
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.<br/>
Raise, raise the song on high,<br/>
The Virgin sings her lullaby:<br/>
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,<br/>
The Babe, the Son of Mary!<br/>
