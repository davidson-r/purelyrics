<br/>
Who knows how near my end may be?<br/>
Time speeds away, and death comes on;<br/>
How swiftly, ah! how suddenly,<br/>
May death be here, and life be gone!<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
The world that smiled when morn was come<br/>
May change for me ere close of eve;<br/>
So long as earth is still my home<br/>
In peril of my death I live;<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
Teach me to ponder oft my end,<br/>
And ere the hour of death appears,<br/>
To cast my soul on Christ her Friend,<br/>
Nor spare repentant cries and tears;<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
And let me now so order all,<br/>
That ever ready I may be,<br/>
To say with joy, whate’er befall,<br/>
Lord, do Thou as Thou wilt with me:<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
O Father, cover all my sins<br/>
With Jesus’ merits, Who alone<br/>
The pardon that I covet wins,<br/>
And makes His long sought rest our own;<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
Then death may come or tarry yet,<br/>
I know in Christ I perish not;<br/>
He never will His own forget,<br/>
He gives me robes without a spot:<br/>
My God, for Jesus’ sake I pray<br/>
Thy peace may bless my dying day.<br/>
<br/>
And thus I live in God at peace,<br/>
And die without a thought or fear,<br/>
Content to take what God decrees,<br/>
For through His Son my faith is clear;<br/>
His grace shall be in death my stay,<br/>
And peace shall bless my dying day.<br/>
