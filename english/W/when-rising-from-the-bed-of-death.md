title: When Rising From The Bed Of Death

<br/>
When rising from the bed of death,<br/>
O’erwhelmed with guilt and fear,<br/>
I see my Maker face to face,<br/>
O how shall I appear?<br/>
<br/>
If yet, while pardon may be found,<br/>
And mercy may be sought,<br/>
My heart with inward horror shrinks,<br/>
And trembles at the thought;<br/>
<br/>
When Thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclosed<br/>
In majesty severe,<br/>
And sit in judgment on my soul,<br/>
O how shall I appear?<br/>
<br/>
But Thou hast told the troubled mind<br/>
Who does her sins lament,<br/>
The timely tribute of her tears<br/>
Shall endless woe prevent.<br/>
<br/>
Then see the sorrow of my heart,<br/>
Ere yet it be too late;<br/>
And hear my Savior’s dying groans,<br/>
To give those sorrows weight.<br/>
<br/>
For never shall my soul despair<br/>
Her pardon to procure,<br/>
Who knows Thine only Son has died<br/>
To make her pardon sure.<br/>
