<br/>
With grateful heart my thanks I bring,<br/>
Before the great Thy praise I sing;<br/>
I worship in Thy holy place<br/>
And praise Thee for Thy truth and grace;<br/>
For truth and grace together shine<br/>
In Thy most holy Word divine,<br/>
In Thy most holy Word divine.<br/>
<br/>
I cried to Thee and Thou didst save,<br/>
Thy Word of grace new courage gave;<br/>
The kings of earth shall thank Thee, Lord,<br/>
For they have heard Thy wondrous Word;<br/>
Yea, they shall come with songs of praise,<br/>
For great and glorious are Thy ways,<br/>
For great and glorious are Thy ways.<br/>
<br/>
O Lord, enthroned in glory bright,<br/>
Thou reignest in the heavenly height;<br/>
The proud in vain Thy favor seek,<br/>
But Thou hast mercy for the meek;<br/>
Through trouble though my pathway be,<br/>
Thou wilt retrieve and strengthen me,<br/>
Thou wilt retrieve and strengthen me.<br/>
<br/>
Thou wilt stretch forth Thy mighty arm<br/>
To save me when my foes alarm;<br/>
The work Thou hast for me begun<br/>
Shall by Thy grace be fully done;<br/>
Forever mercy dwells with Thee;<br/>
O Lord, my Maker, think on me,<br/>
O Lord, my Maker, think on me.<br/>
