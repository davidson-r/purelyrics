<br/>
Why should we start and fear to die?<br/>
What tim’rous worms we mortals are!<br/>
Death is the gate of endless joy,<br/>
And yet we dread to enter there.<br/>
<br/>
The pains, the groans, the dying strife,<br/>
Fright our approaching souls away;<br/>
Still we shrink back again to life,<br/>
Fond of our prison and our clay.<br/>
<br/>
O, if my Lord would come and meet,<br/>
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,<br/>
Fly fearless through death’s iron gate,<br/>
Nor feel the terrors as she passed.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus can make a dying bed<br/>
Feel soft as downy pillows are,<br/>
While on His breast I lean my head,<br/>
And breathe my life out sweetly there.<br/>
