title: While On The Verge Of Life I Stand

<br/>
While on the verge of life I stand,<br/>
And view the scene on either hand,<br/>
My spirit struggles with my clay,<br/>
And longs to wing its flight away.<br/>
<br/>
Where Jesus dwells my soul would be,<br/>
And faints my much loved Lord to see:<br/>
Earth, twine no more about my heart,<br/>
For ’tis far better to depart.<br/>
<br/>
Come, ye angelic envoys, come,<br/>
And lead the willing pilgrim home!<br/>
Ye know the way to Jesus’ throne—<br/>
Source of my joys and of your own.<br/>
<br/>
That blissful interview, how sweet,<br/>
To fall transported at His feet:<br/>
Raised in His arms to view His face,<br/>
Thro’ the full beamings of His grace.<br/>
