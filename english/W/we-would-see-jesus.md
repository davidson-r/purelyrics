title: We would see Jesus

<br/>
We would see Jesus; for the shadows lengthen<br/>
Across this little landscape of our life;<br/>
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen<br/>
For the last weariness, the final strife.<br/>
<br/>
We would see Jesus, the great rock Foundation<br/>
Whereon our feet were set with sovereign grace;<br/>
Nor life nor death, with all their agitation,<br/>
Can thence remove us, if we see His face.<br/>
<br/>
We would see Jesus; other lights are paling,<br/>
Which for long years we have rejoiced to see;<br/>
The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing;<br/>
We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
We would see Jesus; yet the spirit lingers<br/>
Round the dear objects it has loved so long,<br/>
And earth from earth can scarce unclasp its fingers;<br/>
Our love to Thee makes not this love less strong.<br/>
<br/>
We would see Jesus: sense is all too binding,<br/>
And heaven appears too dim, too far away;<br/>
We would see Thee, Thyself our hearts reminding<br/>
What Thou hast suffered, our great debt to pay.<br/>
<br/>
We would see Jesus: this is all weâ€™re needing;<br/>
Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight;<br/>
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading;<br/>
Then welcome day, and farewell mortal night.<br/>
