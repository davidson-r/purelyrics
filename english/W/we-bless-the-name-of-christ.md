We bless the Name of Christ, the Lord,<br/>
We bless Him for His holy Word,<br/>
Who loved to do His Father’s will,<br/>
And all His righteousness fulfill.<br/>
<br/>
We follow Him with pure delight<br/>
To sanctify His sacred rite;<br/>
And thus our faith with water seal,<br/>
To prove obedience that we feel.<br/>
<br/>
Baptized in Godthe Father, Son,<br/>
And Holy SpiritThree in One,<br/>
With conscience free, we rest in God,<br/>
In love and peace, through Jesus’ blood.<br/>
<br/>
By grace we “Abba, Father” cry;<br/>
By grace the Comforter comes nigh;<br/>
And for Thy grace our love shall be<br/>
Forever, only, Lord, for Thee.
