<br/>
What shall I render to my God<br/>
For all His kindness shown?<br/>
My feet shall visit Thine abode,<br/>
My songs address Thy throne.<br/>
<br/>
Among the saints that fill Thine house<br/>
My off’rings shall be paid;<br/>
There shall my zeal perform the vows<br/>
My soul in anguish made.<br/>
<br/>
How much is mercy Thy delight,<br/>
Thou ever blessèd God!<br/>
How dear Thy servants in Thy sight!<br/>
How precious is their blood!<br/>
<br/>
How happy all Thy servants are!<br/>
How great Thy grace to me!<br/>
My life, which thou hast made Thy care,<br/>
Lord, I devote to Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am Thine, forever Thine,<br/>
Nor shall my purpose move<br/>
Thy hand hath loosed my bonds of pain,<br/>
And bound me with Thy love.<br/>
<br/>
Here in Thy courts I leave my vow,<br/>
And Thy rich grace record;<br/>
Witness, ye saints, who hear me now,<br/>
If I forsake the Lord.<br/>
