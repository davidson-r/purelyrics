<br/>
We thank Thee, Lord, for this fair earth,<br/>
The glittering sky, the silver sea;<br/>
For all their beauty, all their worth,<br/>
Their light and glory, come from Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thine are the flowers that cloThe ground,<br/>
The trees that wave their arms above,<br/>
The hills that gird our dwellings round,<br/>
As Thou dost gird Thine own with love.<br/>
<br/>
Yet teach us still how far more fair,<br/>
More glorious, Father, in Thy sight,<br/>
Is one pure deed, one holy prayer,<br/>
One heart that owns Thy Spiritâ€™s might.<br/>
<br/>
So while we gaze with thoughtful eye<br/>
On all the gifts Thy love has given,<br/>
Help us in Thee to live and die,<br/>
By Thee to rise from earth to Heaven.<br/>
