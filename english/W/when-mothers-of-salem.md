<br/>
When mothers of Salem their children brought to Jesus,<br/>
The stern disciples drove them back and bade them to depart:<br/>
But Jesus saw them ere they fled and sweetly smiled and kindly said,<br/>
“Suffer little children to come unto Me.”<br/>
<br/>
“For I will receive them and fold them to My bosom:<br/>
I’ll be a shepherd to these lambs, O drive them not away;<br/>
For if their hearts to Me they give, they shall with Me in glory live:<br/>
Suffer little children to come unto Me.”<br/>
<br/>
How kind was our Savior to bid these children welcome!<br/>
But there are many thousands who have never heard His Name;<br/>
The Bible they have never read, they know not that the Savior said,<br/>
“Suffer little children to come unto Me.”<br/>
<br/>
O soon may the heathen of every tribe and nation<br/>
Fulfill Thy blessèd Word and cast their idols all away!<br/>
O shine upon them from above and show Thyself a God of love,<br/>
Teach the little children to come unto Thee!<br/>
