<br/>
When o’er my sins I sorrow,<br/>
Lord, I will look to Thee<br/>
And hence my comfort borrow<br/>
That Thou wast slain for me;<br/>
Yea, Lord, Thy precious blood was spilt<br/>
For me, O most unworthy,<br/>
To take away my guilt.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what a marvelous offering!<br/>
Behold, the Master spares<br/>
His servants, and their suffering<br/>
And grief for them He bears.<br/>
God stoopeth from His throne on high;<br/>
For me, His guilty creature,<br/>
He deigns as man to die.<br/>
<br/>
My manifold transgression<br/>
Henceforth can harm me none<br/>
Since Jesus’ bloody Passion<br/>
For me God’s grace hath won.<br/>
His precious blood my debts hath paid;<br/>
Of hell and all its torments<br/>
I am no more afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I will forever<br/>
Give glory unto Thee,<br/>
O Jesus, loving Savior,<br/>
For what Thou didst for me.<br/>
I’ll spend my breath in songs of thanks<br/>
For Thy sad cry, Thy sufferings,<br/>
Thy wrongs, Thy guiltless death.<br/>
