<br/>
Who is she ascends so high,<br/>
Next the heav'nly King,<br/>
Round about whom angels fly,<br/>
And her praises sing? <br/>
<br/>
Who is she adorned with light;<br/>
Makes the sun her robe?<br/>
At whose feet the queen of night<br/>
Lays her changing globe? <br/>
<br/>
This is she in whose pure womb<br/>
Heaven's Prince remained;<br/>
Wherefore in no earthly tomb<br/>
Could she be contained. <br/>
<br/>
Heav'n she was, which held that fire,<br/>
Whence the world took light,<br/>
And to heav'n doth now as pire:<br/>
Flames with flames unite. <br/>
<br/>
She that did so clearly shine,<br/>
Our Day once begun,<br/>
See how bright her beams decline,<br/>
Sitting with the Sun. <br/>
