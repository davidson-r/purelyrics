title: What A Friend We Have In Jesus

<br/>
What a friend we have in Jesus, <br/>
all our sins and griefs to bear! <br/>
What a privilege to carry <br/>
everything to God in prayer! <br/>
O what peace we often forfeit,<br/>
O what needless pain we bear, <br/>
all because we do not carry <br/>
everything to God in prayer. <br/>
<br/>
Have we trials and temptations? <br/>
Is there trouble anywhere? <br/>
We should never be discouraged; <br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer. <br/>
Can we find a friend so faithful <br/>
who will all our sorrows share? <br/>
Jesus knows our every weakness; <br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer. <br/>
<br/>
Are we weak and heavy laden, <br/>
cumbered with a load of care? <br/>
Precious Savior, still our refuge; <br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer. <br/>
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? <br/>
Take it to the Lord in prayer! <br/>
In his arms he'll take and shield thee; <br/>
thou wilt find a solace there.<br/>
