title: We Are But Little Children Weak

<br/>
We are but little children weak,<br/>
Nor born in any high estate;<br/>
What can we do for Jesus’ sake,<br/>
Who is so high and good and great?<br/>
<br/>
We know the holy innocents<br/>
Laid down for Him their infant life,<br/>
And martyrs brave and patient saints<br/>
Have stood for Him in fire and strife.<br/>
<br/>
We wear the cross they wore of old<br/>
Our lips have learned like vows to make;<br/>
We need not die; we cannot fight;<br/>
What may we do for Jesus’ sake?<br/>
<br/>
O day by day each Christian child<br/>
Has much to do, without, within;<br/>
A death to die for Jesus’ sake,<br/>
A weary war to wage with sin.<br/>
<br/>
When deep within our swelling hearts<br/>
The thoughts of pride and anger rise,<br/>
When bitter words are on our tongues,<br/>
And tears of passion in our eyes;<br/>
<br/>
Then we may stay the angry blow,<br/>
Then we may check the hasty word,<br/>
Give gentle answers back again,<br/>
And fight a battle for our Lord.<br/>
<br/>
With smiles of peace and looks of love,<br/>
Light in our dwellings we may make,<br/>
Bid kind good humor brighten there,<br/>
And still do all for Jesus’ sake.<br/>
<br/>
There’s not a child so weak and small<br/>
But has his little cross to take,<br/>
His little work of love and praise,<br/>
That he may do for Jesus’ sake.<br/>
