<br/>
Who is He in yonder stall<br/>
At Whose feet the shepherds fall?<br/>
Who is He in deep distress,<br/>
Fasting in the wilderness?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
’Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!<br/>
’Tis the Lord! the King of glory!<br/>
At His feet we humbly fall,<br/>
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!<br/>
<br/>
Who is He the people bless<br/>
For His words of gentleness?<br/>
Who is He to Whom they bring<br/>
All the sick and sorrowing?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Who is He that stands and weeps<br/>
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?<br/>
Who is He the gathering throng<br/>
Greet with loud triumphant song?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Lo! at midnight, who is He<br/>
Prays in dark Gethsemane?<br/>
Who is He on yonder tree<br/>
Dies in grief and agony?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Who is He that from the grave<br/>
Comes to heal and help and save?<br/>
Who is He that from His throne<br/>
Rules through all the world alone?<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
