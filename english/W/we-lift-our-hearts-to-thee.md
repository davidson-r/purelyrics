title: We Lift Our Hearts To Thee

<br/>
We lift our hearts to Thee,<br/>
O Day Star from on high!<br/>
The sun itself is but Thy shade,<br/>
Yet cheers both earth and sky.<br/>
<br/>
O let Thine orient beams<br/>
The night of sin disperse,<br/>
The mists of error and of vice<br/>
Which shade the universe.<br/>
<br/>
How beauteous nature now:<br/>
How dark and sad before!<br/>
With joy we view the pleasing change,<br/>
And nature’s God adore.<br/>
<br/>
O may no gloomy crime<br/>
Pollute the rising day;<br/>
Or Jesus’ blood, like evening dew,<br/>
Wash all the stains away.<br/>
<br/>
May we this life improve,<br/>
To mourn for errors past;<br/>
And live this short, revolving day<br/>
As if it were our last.<br/>
<br/>
To God the Father, Son,<br/>
And Spirit One in Three,<br/>
Be glory; as it was, is now,<br/>
And shall forever be.<br/>
