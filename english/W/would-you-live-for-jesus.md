<br/>
Would you live for Jesus, and be always pure and good?<br/>
Would you walk with Him within the narrow road?<br/>
Would you have Him bear your burden, carry all your load?<br/>
Let Him have His way with thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
His power can make you what you ought to be;<br/>
His blood can cleanse your heart and make you free;<br/>
His love can fill your soul, and you will see<br/>
â€™Twas best for Him to have His way with thee.<br/>
<br/>
Would you have Him make you free, and follow at His call?<br/>
Would you know the peace that comes by giving all?<br/>
Would you have Him save you, so that you can never fall?<br/>
Let Him have His way with thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Would you in His kingdom find a place of constant rest?<br/>
Would you prove Him true in providential test?<br/>
Would you in His service labor always at your best?<br/>
Let Him have His way with thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
