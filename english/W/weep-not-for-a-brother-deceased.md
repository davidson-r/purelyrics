<br/>
Weep not for a brother deceased;<br/>
Our loss is his infinite gain;<br/>
A soul out of prison released,<br/>
And freed from its bodily chain;<br/>
With songs let us follow his flight,<br/>
And mount with his spirit above,<br/>
Escaped to the mansions of light,<br/>
And lodged in the Eden of love.<br/>
<br/>
Our brother the haven has gained,<br/>
Outflying the tempest and wind;<br/>
His rest he hath sooner obtained,<br/>
And left his companions behind,<br/>
Still tossed on a sea of distress,<br/>
Hard toiling to make the blest shore,<br/>
Where all is assurance and peace,<br/>
And sorrow and sin are no more.<br/>
<br/>
There all the ship’s company meet,<br/>
Who sailed with the Savior beneath,<br/>
With shouting each other they greet,<br/>
And triumph o’er sorrow and death;<br/>
The voyage of life’s at an end;<br/>
The mortal affliction is past;<br/>
The age that in Heaven they spend,<br/>
Forever and ever shall last.<br/>
