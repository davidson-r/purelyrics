<br/>
When God Of Old Came Down From Heaven,<br/>
In Power And Wrath He Came;<br/>
Before His Feet The Clouds Were Riven,<br/>
Half Darkness And Half Flame:<br/>
<br/>
But When He Came The Second Time,<br/>
He Came In Power And Love;<br/>
Softer Than Gale At Morning Prime<br/>
Hovered His Holy Dove.<br/>
<br/>
The Fires, That Rushed On Sinai Down<br/>
In Sudden Torrents Dread,<br/>
Now Gently Light, A Glorious Crown,<br/>
On Every Sainted Head.<br/>
<br/>
And As On Israel's Awestruck Ear<br/>
The Voice Exceeding Loud,<br/>
The Trump That Angels Quake To Hear,<br/>
Thrilled From The Deep, Dark Cloud;<br/>
<br/>
So, When The Spirit Of Our God<br/>
Came Down His Flock To Find,<br/>
A Voice From Heaven Was Heard Abroad,<br/>
A Rushing, Mighty Wind.<br/>
<br/>
It Fills The Church Of God; It Fills<br/>
The Sinful World Around;<br/>
Only In Stubborn Hearts And Wills<br/>
No Place For It Is Found.<br/>
<br/>
Come Lord, Come Wisdom, Love And Power,<br/>
Open Our Ears To Hear;<br/>
Let Us Not Miss The Accepted Hour;<br/>
Save, Lord, By Love Or Fear.<br/>
