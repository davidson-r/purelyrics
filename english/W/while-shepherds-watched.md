title: While Shepherds Watched

<br/>
While shepherds watched<br/>
Their flocks by night<br/>
All seated on the ground<br/>
The angel of the Lord came down<br/>
And glory shone around<br/>
And glory shone around<br/>
<br/>
"Fear not," he said,<br/>
For mighty dread<br/>
Had seized their troubled minds<br/>
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring<br/>
To you and all mankind,<br/>
To you and all mankind."<br/>
<br/>
"To you in David's<br/>
Town this day<br/>
Is born of David's line<br/>
The Savior who is Christ the Lord<br/>
And this shall be the sign<br/>
And this shall be the sign."<br/>
<br/>
"The heavenly Babe<br/>
You there shall find<br/>
To human view displayed<br/>
And meanly wrapped<br/>
In swathing bands<br/>
And in a manger laid<br/>
And in a manger laid."<br/>
<br/>
Thus spake the seraph,<br/>
And forthwith<br/>
Appeared a shining throng<br/>
Of angels praising God, who thus<br/>
Addressed their joyful song<br/>
Addressed their joyful song<br/>
<br/>
"All glory be to<br/>
God on high<br/>
And to the earth be peace;<br/>
Goodwill henceforth<br/>
From heaven to men<br/>
Begin and never cease<br/>
Begin and never cease!"<br/>
