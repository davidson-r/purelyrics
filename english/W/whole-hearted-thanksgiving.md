<br/>
Whole-hearted thanksgiving to Thee I will bring<br/>
In praise of Thy marvelous deeds I will sing;<br/>
In Thee I will joy and exultingly cry,<br/>
Thy Name I will praise, O Jehovah, Most High.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice!<br/>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people rejoice!<br/>
O come to Jehovah, declare ye His fame,<br/>
And give Him all honor, for just is His Name.<br/>
<br/>
My enemies turn and are scattered in fear,<br/>
They stumble and perish because Thou art near;<br/>
For Thou hast defended my right and my cause,<br/>
Thou sittest in judgment, upholding Thy laws.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Rebuked are the nations, the wicked destroyed;<br/>
Their memory perished, their dwelling place void;<br/>
Enthroned and eternal, Jehovah shall reign,<br/>
The peoples to judge and the right to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Thou, Lord, art a Refuge for all the oppressed,<br/>
All trust Thee who know Thee, and trusting are blest;<br/>
For never, O Lord, did Thy mercy forsake<br/>
The soul that has sought of Thy grace to partake.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Give praise to Jehovah, the mighty deeds tell<br/>
Of Him Who has chosen in Zion to dwell,<br/>
Of Him to Whom justice and vengeance belong,<br/>
Who visits the lowly and overthrows wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Behold my affliction, Thy mercy accord,<br/>
And back from death’s portals restore me, O Lord,<br/>
That I in the gates of Thy Zion may raise<br/>
My song of salvation and show forth Thy praise.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The sins of the nations their ruin have wrought,<br/>
Their own evildoing destruction has brought;<br/>
In this the Lord’s justice eternally stands,<br/>
That sinners are snared in the work of their hands.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
The wicked shall perish, the nations shall fall,<br/>
Forgetting their God, Who is God over all;<br/>
But God will remember the prayer of the weak,<br/>
Most surely fulfilling the hope of the meek.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
<br/>
Arise in Thy justice, O Lord, and Thy might,<br/>
No longer let sinners prevail in Thy sight;<br/>
Great Judge of the of the nations, in judgment appear<br/>
To humble the proud and to teach them Thy fear.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
