of old\nOur lips have learned like vows to make;\nWe need not die; we cannot fight;\nWhat may we do for Jesus’ sake?\n\nO day by day each Christian child\nHas much to do, without, within;\nA death to die for Jesus’ sake,\nA weary war to wage with sin.\n\nWhen deep within our swelling hearts\nThe thoughts of pride and anger rise,\nWhen bitter words are on our tongues,\nAnd tears of passion in our eyes.\n\nThen we may stay the angry blow,\nThen we may check the hasty word,\nGive gentle answers back again,\nAnd fight a battle for our Lord.\n\nWith smiles of peace and looks of love,\nLight in our dwellings we may make,\nBid kind good humor brighten there,\nAnd still do all for Jesus’ sake.\n\nThere’s not a child so weak and small\nBut has his little cross to take,\nHis little work of love and praise,\nThat he may do for Jesus’ sake.\n","slug":"o-lord-holy-innocents"},{"letter":"o","title":"O Lord Of Life, Thy Quickening Voice","lyrics":"\nO Lord of life, Thy quickening voice,\nAwakes my

give.”\n\n“Resurrection and the life—I am both,” Jesus did say.\n“He who does believe in Me, he will live beyond the grave.\nHe who lives, believes in Me, he will ne’er to death succumb.”\nMartha said, “You are the Christ; You’re the One who was to come.\nYou’re the Christ, the Son of God; You’re the One Who was to come.”\n\nMartha then her sister called; Mary went to meet the Lord.\nWhen she reached Him, knelt in tears, seeking comfort from His word.\nJesus, deeply moved, did ask, “Where have you his body laid?”\nAnd He wept when He did see, for His love was very great.\nJesus wept and shared their grief, for His love was very great.\n\nJesus then approached the tomb. “Take away the stone,” He said.\n“But,” said Martha, “there’s a stench, for four days he has been dead.”\nJesus said, “You now will see God’s great glory—just believe.”\nSo they took away the stone, and he prayed, “May they believe;\nFather, thank You, You have heard; may they now in Me believe.”\n\nJesus then did give command; in a loud voice He did say,\n“Laz’rus, come out of the tomb!” And the dead man did obey.\nBoth his hands and feet were bound, and a cloth did hide his face.\n“Take the grave clothes; let him go,” Jesus said to those amazed.\n“Said I not, believe and see God’s great glory in this place?”\n\nJust as Jesus gave new life to a man when he was dead,\nHe can do the same for all who believe what He has said.\nFor we all in sin are dead; resurrection life we need.\nJesus died and rose again, that we might from sin be freed.\nAll who put their trust in Him will not die but live
